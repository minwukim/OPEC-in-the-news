At last, however, as he approached his 70th year, the trick failed him. Voters in the Democratic primary decided that Fulbright had neglected them and that they preferred instead an immensely popular young Governor named Dale Bumpers, young enough to be Fulbrighfs son, new enough to have almost no history and no enemies. Bumpers had declared throughout his campaign that there was a mess in Washington, and that Fulbright had been there all those years.

Driving this realization into the consciousness of the American people was doubtless the President's main accomplishment. It remains to be seen, however, whether he has the political support to get his program through Congress. On one side, Mr. Carter is likely to be hit for proposing to rely too much on higher prices and taxes to curb the demand for oil and gas.
