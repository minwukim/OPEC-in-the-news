"  The Exxon Corporation, benefiting from lower and more stable crude oil prices, increased its earnings in the second quarter by 27.2 percent, the company announced yesterday.   The earnings rise at the world's largest energy company, coming four months after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its crude oil prices 15 percent, reflects improved business conditions in much of the oil industry.   About a third of the earnings improvement came overseas. Exxon, one of the four American partners in the Arabian American Oil Company, which produces almost all of Saudi Arabia's oil, had suffered from a price disadvantage until the OPEC decision in March because Saudi Arabia was charging more for its oil than most other OPEC members.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/26/business/earnings-rise-27.2-at-exxon.html","","The Exxon Corporation, benefiting from lower and more stable crude oil prices, increased its earnings in the second quarter by 27.2 percent, the company announced yesterday.","D","1","1983-07-26T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/cd67904a-09b6-5bd5-9dbd-f9a2e2933945",795,"nyt://article/cd67904a-09b6-5bd5-9dbd-f9a2e2933945"

"  The Mobil Corporation said yesterday that its earnings jumped 40.1 percent in the second quarter, to $402 million.  The gain by the nation's second-largest energy concern reflected lower crude oil prices and better profits on gasoline, factors that have helped several major oil companies.   Two other large energy concerns also reported increased profits, with Tenneco Inc. posting a small gain of less than 1 percent and the Phillips Petroleum Company reporting a 15.8 percent increase.   Analysts say that one of the main reasons for the improved earnings is better profits on refined petroleum products. Since March, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to a 15 percent reduction in its crude oil prices, the price of gasoline and some other refined products has risen. Thus, the companies' margins have sharply widened.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/28/business/mobil-posts-40.1-rise-tenneco-up.html","","The Mobil Corporation said yesterday that its earnings jumped 40.1 percent in the second quarter, to $402 million.

"  Nigeria is now moving into the final stages of campaigning for a series of elections that will not only determine who will lead Nigeria for the next four years but will also test its commitment to democracy.    With a population generally estimated at somewhere between 80 and 100 million, Nigeria is both the fourth largest multiparty democracy in the world - after India, the United States and Japan - and one of the few countries in Africa where every citizen enjoys the right to vote for a choice of candidates any one of whom could actually win.   Six political parties are campaigning for the presidential, gubernatorial, senatorial, congressional and state assembly elections scheduled for consecutive Saturdays beginning this weekend. Most of the country's attention, however, is focused on the race between the three leading candidates for president: Shehu Shagari, 62 years old, the aristocratic and moderate incumbent and leader of the National Party of Nigeria; Chief Obafemi Awolowo, 74, a tough and skillful politician who has figured prominently in Nigerian politics since the early 1940's and who now heads the Unity Party of Nigeria, and Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, 78, who was Nigeria's first President and who leads the Nigerian People's Party.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/02/world/nigeria-puts-its-commitment-to-democracy-to-major-test.html","","Nigeria is now moving into the final stages of campaigning for a series of elections that will not only determine who will lead Nigeria for the next four years but will also test its commitment to democracy.","A","6","1983-08-02T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/498ae9c5-8de1-5292-a98c-e6e7ffcdec0f",1061,"nyt://article/498ae9c5-8de1-5292-a98c-e6e7ffcdec0f"

This summer, when Shehu Shagari was elected to a second term as President, the census bureau estimated the population at 91 million. Sixty-five million people were registered to vote - 16 million more than in the l979 elections. Thus, in a country with a long history of polygamy, with families that include many children, over 71 percent of the population is registered to vote - steep even by demographic standards in Western democracies, with far fewer youngsters.   Census data are politically volatile in Nigeria, where they are used to validate voter- registration figures.

"Economic Analysis    The world economy today, as it enters a second decade of coping with much more costly energy, can expect an uneven recovery, with the United States moving ahead more briskly than its industrial partners or the countries of the third world. And the enormous debts that oil-importing nations have piled up jeopardize the world's financial security.   But the world has indeed coped with the tumult of the 1970's, although it is gripped with a residue of broad structural unemployment, and the world's leaders have learned some important lessons.    The oil price explosion and the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74 dealt an unprecedented and lasting shock to the world economy - a shock that, paradoxically, brought both inflation and recession.   A worldwide economic slump ensued, in large measure a result of the efforts over the decade to fight the oil-induced inflation. The slump, in turn, led to an oil glut in the early 1980's, driving oil prices back down.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/28/business/the-painful-shift-to-costly-oil.html","","Economic Analysis","D","1","1983-09-28T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/5d5c22ce-5852-53f5-a997-34fbabd67831",2276,"nyt://article/5d5c22ce-5852-53f5-a997-34fbabd67831"

''The world has entered a period of comparatively abundant energy supplies,'' Conoco Inc. said in a recent comprehensive forecast.   Only the developing nations face the prospect of significant increases in the need for fuels, and experts believe they will be able to modernize using far less energy per unit of output than did today's industrial countries. Even if a few nations, especially Japan, are still dependent on imports for almost all their oil and gas, they are leagues ahead of where they were a decade ago.   The good news on oil supplies is the direct result of the last decade's bad news: the oil price run-up that is estimated by Daniel Yergin of Harvard University to have cost the world more than a trillion dollars in lost economic growth.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/30/business/world-uses-less-of-a-new-mix-of-fuels.html","","Despite the sporadic energy shortages of the last decade, experts now concur that for the balance of this century, barring a major political upheaval in the Middle East, Americans have scant chance of sitting in a gasoline line or of seeing plants close because of a lack of fuel.","D","1","1983-09-30T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/c1da9cf8-cc78-52e1-b24b-af68c993da06",1692,"nyt://article/c1da9cf8-cc78-52e1-b24b-af68c993da06"

THE official tone at the International Monetary   Fund's annual conference in Washington last   week was guardedly optimistic. The forecasts framing the discussion called for an economic recovery in the industrial nations modest enough to allow interest rates to subside but rapid enough to enable the nations of the third world to begin working down their mountainous debt. ''The recovery is growing strongly and the adjustment process is working very fast,'' declared Jacques de Larosie re, the I.M.F.'s managing director, with considerable confidence.   The conference focused on replenishing the resources of the I.M.F. and other world lending agencies. Officials clearly felt threatened by the balky United States Congress, which has yet to vote an increase in the American contribution to the fund. But the general view at the meeting was that once Congress comes through - which most expect - the I.M.F.'s slow-growth game plan for dealing with the world financial crisis, adopted at last year's meeting in Toronto, would work.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/02/business/the-imf-s-perilous-plan-for-growth.html","","This article was reported by Jeffrey Madrick and William Wolman and written by Mr. Wolman.","3","1","1983-10-02T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/421522d0-7e7f-5ac4-b0f1-ff62fae3b1a2",3662,"nyt://article/421522d0-7e7f-5ac4-b0f1-ff62fae3b1a2"

The 1970's seem far away now, but strategic thinking is increasingly focused on the Middle East and Persian Gulf.  Not since the face-off in Europe after World War II have the two superpowers brought their might so close to each other, and nowhere else are their conflicting commitments so interlaced and so subject to age-old regional rivalries.   At the same time, the Reagan Administration appears somewhat divided over what to do and, indeed, over the importance of Middle East oil to the United States.

Ten years later the boom in the energy industry has quieted to an efficient hum. Attention has been diverted to other problems as the price of crude oil has fallen and the economy moves into and out of recessions. As a result, some experts feel that the drive to develop American energy resources is suffering from procrastination.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/16/jobs/the-pep-s-out-of-hiring-in-the-energy-field.html","","IT WAS an event that permeated the life","12","25","1983-10-16T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/df50b2d6-45d9-55a4-ae70-03a343465416",1154,"nyt://article/df50b2d6-45d9-55a4-ae70-03a343465416"

Banks, having lent prodigally to Latin American and other developing countries during the 1970's and early 1980's, are now scrambling to reduce their foreign exposure.   The Bank for International Settlements, whose members include the central banks of most major industrial countries, reported last month on the foreign loans of private banks during the second quarter of 1983: ''For the first time since quarterly data began to be collected in 1963, the second-quarter figures showed only a very marginal growth of international bank activity.''     Excluding the effects of exchange rates, banks in the industrial countries increased their loans to countries outside their own areas by less than half a percent in the second quarter. In current dollars, Western banks increased their assets in the developing countries by just $6 billion in April-June 1983, compared with an increase of $67.1 billion in July- September 1982.

Nigeria, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has a history of offering oil price discounts to increase its share of the world market.

As part of that effort, the general said, the new Government would continue its discussions with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and corporate creditors.   ''We trust that these institutions will cooperate with us fully and assist in bailing us out of our ailing economy,'' he said.","https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/06/world/new-nigerian-leader-asks-creditors-not-to-press-hard.html","","The leader of Nigeria's new military Government, Maj.

"  THE two decades after World War II have been    called a ''golden age'' of growth and stability for   the United States and the rest of the industrial world. ''In the 'Golden Age' of the 1950's and 1960's,'' said Angus Maddison, a British economist, ''economic growth in the advanced capitalist countries surpassed virtually all historical records.''    But, starting in the late 1960's, the United States economy was battered by a series of economic and political shocks that turned the golden age into an age of tin. First came President Johnson's ''guns and butter'' policy that bred inflation during the Vietnam war; then came President Nixon's surprise of Aug. 15, 1971, when he suspended convertibility of the dollar into gold, imposed wage-price controls and embarked on a highly stimulative fiscal and monetary policy. International financial chaos and the end of the Bretton Woods monetary system of fixed exchange rates hit the world economy in 1973, and the OPEC nations twice in that decade tipped the world into economic shock with monumental increases in oil prices.","https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/08/business/recovering-from-the-era-of-shocks.html","","THE two decades after World War II have been","3","1","1984-01-08T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/1b2f196a-ec40-5c98-b8c4-255fbe028545",2633,"nyt://article/1b2f196a-ec40-5c98-b8c4-255fbe028545"

"  Disposable Funds     The growth of consumer spending - always an important economic statistic because it accounts for roughly two-thirds of the nation's gross national product - appears likely to hold steady, economists are saying. This is expected to be confirmed when the Government announces December's personal income figures Thursday, in effect saying how much consumers can spend.  But whether consumers    want    to spend often depends on their ''household net worth'' - not including the value of their homes. Since the stock market upturn that began in August 1982, household net worth has soared by more than $1 trillion - much of that traceable to increased stock performance.  As for personal income, Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, expects the December figures to show a slight year- to-year rise of eight-tenths of 1 percent, compared with seven-tenths of 1 percent in November and 1.1 percent last October. What consumers spend or save is actually disposable income - personal income minus taxes.    Gobbling Up Food Stocks   Because people have to eat whether stock prices move up or down, food company shares are usually favored by investors as ''defensive issues'' when the market retreats. At such times, the highly visible earnings and dividends of food companies reassure investors. But when the market is strong, investors are more willing to settle for promises than performance.","https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/15/business/prospects.html","","Disposable Funds","3","1","1984-01-15T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/0302750f-26f3-5556-ae07-369d73040709",696,"nyt://article/0302750f-26f3-5556-ae07-369d73040709"

"  To the Editor:   Your interesting survey of lessons to be drawn from the American economic experience since the mid- 1960's contains two pieces of conventional wisdom that require challenge (''Recovering From the Era of Shocks,'' Jan. 8). Both conceal the operation of powerful forces in the world economy which are as important for the present and future as they were in the past.     The two misleading assertions are: (1) Our long bout of exacerbated inflation was triggered by President Johnson's failure to get the tax increase in 1966 that he finally did get in 1968; and (2) the price explosion, which began at the end of 1972, was triggered by the lifting of President Nixon's wage and price controls of 1971-1972.   Most economists, including myself, would have preferred at the time and in retrospect to have seen President Johnson succeed in persuading Wilbur Mills to join forces in achieving a tax increase in 1966. But two quite different inflationary forces began to operate in the mid-1960's throughout the world economy much more powerful than the marginal difference a 1966 United States tax increase would have made.","https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/12/business/l-rostow-s-reading-of-economic-history-242077.html","","To the Editor:","3","10","1984-02-12T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/31b1798c-8799-5afd-8a6f-3620ba14e2a3",720,"nyt://article/31b1798c-8799-5afd-8a6f-3620ba14e2a3"

"  TEN years ago, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries clamped an embargo    on oil and sent petroleum prices soaring, the world's major oil companies scoured the globe, spending billions of dollars drilling for the precious commodity.   In the past 10 weeks, the major companies have again been in a rush to spend billions - but this time to buy up their sister oil companies. Three of the world's largest producers - Royal Dutch/Shell, Texaco and Standard Oil of California - are set to spend $28.5 billion on these takeovers. Although they still spend billions on drilling new wells, not a cent of the staggering new outlay for acquisitions is directly aimed at searching for new reserves.    For the domestic oil industry, the snowballing merger movement marks a major turning point. After the whirlwind decade of the 70's, dominated by OPEC's gyrations, the industry has reached a slow- growing maturity. Domestic reserves are shrinking, prices and profits have weakened, refining and marketing operations are suffering from huge overcapacity.","https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/11/business/an-unsettling-shift-in-big-oil.html","","TEN years ago, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries clamped an embargo","3","1","1984-03-11T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/f4fd4b4f-addf-5177-b394-225a649bf82a",2536,"nyt://article/f4fd4b4f-addf-5177-b394-225a649bf82a"

"  JACKSONVILLE, Fla.    JUST last month, the Charter Company, a $5.6 billion oil and insurance conglomerate that was once Wall Street's favorite,   touted itself as a hard-charging, vibrant growth company. Its annual report, dated March 26, displayed a color photograph of smiling Charter chairman Raymond K. Mason, assuring shareholders that the company's ''financial condition continues to be strong.'' In truth, however, Charter was weak - very weak. Twenty-five days later, the company declared bankruptcy and, in so doing, ended a four-year high-wire act during which it had struggled to shore up its shrinking cash supply through financial gyrations while its basic business was slowly bleeding to death.   The end of this corporate saga also closes a chapter in the colorful and volatile life of Mr. Mason, 57, a swashbuckling Florida legend whose penchant for deal-making transformed a small family lumber yard that he took over in 1963 into one of the nation's largest oil companies in the boom of the 70's.

About two decades ago, growth in manufacturing slowed, and our national economy entered a period of fundamental change and great instability: productivity slowed, imports loomed larger and OPEC created an energy shock that affected all industrialized nations.

Saudi Light, the crude that OPEC uses as a reference for pricing all its varied grades of petroleum, is trading at about $28 for a 42-gallon barrel, below its official contract price of $29. This trading is on the spot, or noncontract, market, where competition is working fiercely to keep prices down. Arab Oil and Gas, a trade publication, said this week that as much as 45 percent of all internationally traded oil is sold on the spot market.","https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/07/business/war-or-no-oil-market-stable-supplies-are-still-plentiful.html","","Even in a week when both Iran and Iraq have attacked tankers, the price of oil is still in the doldrums.","1","33","1984-07-07T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/9c7de4a2-03b5-55be-aba5-74bf1fbcb11d",997,"nyt://article/9c7de4a2-03b5-55be-aba5-74bf1fbcb11d"
"  DEBT SHOCK     The Full Story of the World Credit Crisis.  By Darrell Delamaide.  280 pp. New York: Doubleday & Co. $15.95.     TEN years ago the Harvard University economics professor Richard Caves was winding up a course on the international monetary system. A student asked why the course had completely skirted the issue then dominating the financial pages - the threat to financial stability posed by the massive lending to third world countries of petrodollars invested in the West by the oil-producing countries of OPEC. Placing himself above the journalistic uproar, Mr. Caves replied, ''The information we have on that is merely anecdotal.'' A decade later, we have more than a few anecdotes to go on, and it is probably safe to assume that the crisis of recycling is even being discussed at Harvard. Indeed, one useful text this year might be ''Debt Shock,'' which tells the story of the foreign lending spree, how it started and where it all might end.","https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/08/books/in-for-a-dime-in-for-a-dollar.html","","DEBT SHOCK","7","6","1984-07-08T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/25ef9f7f-fd08-58fb-881f-2053acceb052",1537,"nyt://article/25ef9f7f-fd08-58fb-881f-2053acceb052"
"  The 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries who will meet beginning tomorrow in Vienna are split into uneasy factions amid an oversupply of oil and increased fighting in the Persian Gulf.    Some members have violated price and production levels set by the cartel and there are questions whether OPEC can maintain its official price of $29 a barrel.   Few analysts believe major official changes will be announced at the regular meeting, the first since December. Most, however, suggest that, unofficially, some of the poorer OPEC nations will be allowed to increase their oil production - and thus their export revenues - at the expense of richer members such as Saudi Arabia. And there will be a renewed commitment to limit total OPEC production enough so that oil prices do not tumble, analysts say.","https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/09/business/opec-still-divided-as-talks-near.html","","The 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries who will meet beginning tomorrow in Vienna are split into uneasy factions amid an oversupply of oil and increased fighting in the Persian Gulf.","D","1","1984-07-09T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/2b631ad8-a8b9-5840-b4d2-3d0ca78f1f85",847,"nyt://article/2b631ad8-a8b9-5840-b4d2-3d0ca78f1f85"

"   Remarkably, in the face of the economy's continued rapid growth, the stubbornly high inflation that blighted the American economy for more than a decade has dissipated, and a vast majority of the nation's economists see little reason for it to return for as far as they can predict into the 1980's.    Prices continue to rise, of course, but at lower rates than the country has seen since the 1960's.   Some experts say the United States may have entered a long-lived period of disinflation in which a broad range of prices would increase at a rate significantly slower than in the past.    Economists attribute this slowing of inflation partly to the determination of the Federal Reserve to discourage rising prices - by restraining growth of the money supply, starving demand for credit and letting interest rates soar - even at the cost of the long 1981-82 recession.   Convergence of Forces    Economists also cite the fortuitous anti-inflationary convergence of several other forces: the surprising strength of the dollar, softening prices for vital raw materials such as oil, food and other commodities, a low level of wage increases, and deregulation of such industries as airlines and telecommunications.","https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/12/business/why-inflation-remains-low.html","","Remarkably, in the face of the economy's continued rapid growth, the stubbornly high inflation that blighted the American economy for more than a decade has dissipated, and a vast majority of the nation's economists see little reason for it to return for as far as they can predict into the 1980's.","D","1","1984-07-12T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/9010b4ea-e1db-5e78-a81f-c9618194bb23",1705,"nyt://article/9010b4ea-e1db-5e78-a81f-c9618194bb23"

"  WHAT is the stock market so worried about? Is it inflation? Or is it recession and deflation - and the fallout on many business corporations?    Inflationary expectations took deep root in the public mind during that long spell of rising prices that lasted from the buildup of the Vietnam War to the deep recession of 1981-82. Those inflationary expectations are still being nourished by worries about the huge budget deficits stretching, as David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in one of his characteristically unguarded moments, ''as far as the eye can see.''

"  As the OPEC oil ministers gather this week in Geneva, they face three formidable challenges to their increasingly battered pricing system.   Those challenges are the warm winter enjoyed by most consuming countries, the discounts offered by Norway and Britain and the task of reducing the price differentials between light and heavy crude oil.   Many other problems await Wednesday's conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries: cheating by about 10 of the 13 OPEC members in official prices or production levels; Nigeria's abandonment of OPEC prices and quotas; conflicts of interest within the organization; its diminishing credibility, and a market psychology that, though fickle, now runs against it.   ''At no point in the last decade has the cartel been faced with so many real and diverse challenges to their ability to control the price of oil,'' said Peter C. Beutel, an analyst with the Rudolf Wolff Energy Group in New York. ''This meeting must address certain fundamental issues if OPEC is to regain the full measure of pricing clout it until recently enjoyed.''","https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/17/business/oil-parley-faces-big-obstacles.html","","As the OPEC oil ministers gather this week in Geneva, they face three formidable challenges to their increasingly battered pricing system.","D","1","1984-12-17T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/fb1873ac-f043-5bc6-b8b4-4c7acd3915e7",1221,"nyt://article/fb1873ac-f043-5bc6-b8b4-4c7acd3915e7"

"   Ministers of the 13 OPEC countries adjourned a first round of formal talks on pricing today that has thus far yielded only a stern admonition to North Sea oil producers not to undermine OPEC prices.     The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' formal winter talks began with the conference president, Indonesia's oil minister, Subroto, warning North Sea oil producers that any attempt to link the price of their crude to spot, or non-contract, prices would ''destabilize the market'' and upset the ''delicately balanced world oil price structure.''    Subroto told reporters after the meeting that the ministers would take up discussion of a shift in price differentials, the only concrete proposal put forth thus far to support flagging crude oil prices, when the talks resume on Thursday.    Seek to Halt Decline    The foremost goal of the oil ministers is to halt the continued decline of crude oil prices that has resulted from slack demand brought on by usually mild weather in the Northern Hemisphere, increased oil conservation and slow economic activity in many parts of the world. The 13 members of the organization last met in emergency session in late October, agreeing then to slow the flow of OPEC oil and stabilize prices in a market softened by oversupply.","https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/20/business/opec-s-opening-talks-yield-little-progress.html","","Ministers of the 13 OPEC countries adjourned a first round of formal talks on pricing today that has thus far yielded only a stern admonition to North Sea oil producers not to undermine OPEC prices.","D","1","1984-12-20T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/144833ec-ac66-520c-a598-44d813d8506e",717,"nyt://article/144833ec-ac66-520c-a598-44d813d8506e"

Many economists had begun to worry that we had already entered a recession, but it now looks as though the economy will continue to advance at a moderate rate through 1985.   The Commerce Department's ''flash,'' or preliminary, estimate is that the economy grew in the final quarter of 1984 at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, up from a revised figure of 1.6 percent for the third quarter.   In fact, the fourth-quarter improvement was greater than a simple comparison of the quarter- to-quarter changes in real gross national product - total output, corrected for inflation - implies. For final sales - the real G.N.P. minus the change in inventories - actually declined 1 percent in the third quarter, and the preliminary data suggest that final sales grew 4 percent or more in the fourth quarter.

Analysts saw the rise as confirmation that the economy had rebounded from a spell of slow growth and is poised for continued expansion. They attributed the improvement partly to recent moves by the Federal Reserve to let interest rates decline. But few economists expect a return of boom-like conditions. (Page 1.)

"  To the Editor:     With the news that the budget deficit is increasing faster than expected, it seems odd that the Administration does not take the obvious steps to reduce our trade balance for imported oil - especially when our dependence on it is rapidly increasing, thus placing us in a far worse position than we were in during the early 1970's.   If imports continue unabated, not only will we be very vulnerable to any supply interruption, but also our domestic refining industry will continue to contract, giving permanence to the situation. In the last couple of years, more than 150 U.S. refineries have shut down, and more refineries will close in the foreseeable future.  All the talk of exporting Alaskan oil to help our trade balance with Japan is illusory. That would only increase revenues to Alaska (what happened to the concept of the greatest good for the greatest number?) and increase our dependence on foreign crude sources, since secure exported domestic crude will have to be replaced by insecure foreign crude.  It seems ironic that, with all the money spent for filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve program, if ever there were an emergency when we had to refine this crude oil, we might not have the necessary domestic refining capacity to do the job.  OPEC countries are now getting into the refining end of the oil business and will soon flood the market with cheap products that our domestic refineries cannot compete with.","https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/12/opinion/l-for-a-stiff-import-on-crude-oil-209307.html","","To the Editor:","1","20","1985-01-12T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/0f062a6e-016e-5411-b44c-d5ae230b1c5e",312,"nyt://article/0f062a6e-016e-5411-b44c-d5ae230b1c5e"

"  To the Editor:     William Safire's Jan. 3 column, ''Glutsmanship,'' on ways to defeat the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is Cinderella thinking on energy - wishing will make it so. Cracking OPEC has become an obsessive campaign to some.    The term ''collapse'' has been applied to drops in the spot-market price for light-gravity crude oil of around $2 a barrel, less than 7 percent of the $29- a-barrel OPEC market level; another drop of $1 would still be only about a 10 percent decrease. But a 7 to 10 percent price cut is not the stuff of which collapse is made. The $15 a barrel that Mr. Safire suggests as utopian for consumers is significantly lower than production costs of much ''frontier'' oil, including that from the North Sea and Alaska. Such pricing would effectively back out some oil supplies and discourage exploration.","https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/20/opinion/l-we-re-in-the-same-world-economic-boat-with-opec-225285.html","","To the Editor:","4","22","1985-01-20T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/f229a745-6aa0-5b57-814c-085304f06684",571,"nyt://article/f229a745-6aa0-5b57-814c-085304f06684"

"IN recent weeks, Wall Street arbitragers have received much attention due to enormous losses suffered when several proposed acquisitions - including the T. Boone Pickens bid for Phillips Petroleum and the Occidental Petroleum acquisition of Diamond Shamrock - did not go through.

Their conclusion is to advocate greater Government regulation of all these trading activities, including risk arbitrage interest rate futures, stock index futures, options on stock index futures, options on interest rate futures, currency futures and petroleum and other commodities futures. 

I have been deeply involved in many of these activities for a long time, and to me the reality as to social benefit seems just the opposite.

"  THURSDAY, JANUARY 31, 1985        International         Nine members of OPEC agreed to cut prices modestly , but three others dissented and one abstained. The cuts, affecting several grades of oil, represent a major step toward linking the group's official prices to free-market levels. But the new prices would still be above current market levels. That raises questions about OPEC's ability to win back customers and regain its dominance. (Page A1.)

THROUGHOUT the 1970's, the developing nations of the Southern Hemisphere capitalized on their control of scarce and expensive commodities and a growing share of world commerce to pry a few trade and financial concessions from the rich nations of the north. The ultimate goal of southern strategists was to convene ''Global Negotiations,'' a radical version of the 1944 Bretton Woods conference that estab- lished the postwar monetary system. The negotiations, in their view, would redress historic inequities in terms of international trade and finance and give the south more control of such institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which they saw as thinly veiled instruments of northern imperialism.","https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/03/books/scramble-to-survive.html","","-South Negotiations.

"  THE Federal Trade Commission last week gave    its final approval to Chevron's $13.3 billion acquisition of Gulf. At the same time, the Standard Oil Company (Indiana) asked its shareholders to approve a long list of predator repellents and continued preparations to spin off its wobbling mining subsidiary; Texaco announced the closing of yet another large refinery, and Exxon continued to support its stock price with huge purchases of its own shares in the open market.    From high-rise corporate headquarters to the massive rigs that dot the Gulf of Mexico, it is clear that a shakeout is in full force in the oil industry. The persistent oil glut, which has brought on weak prices and falling profits, has sent companies scurrying to cut costs, shut down capacity and sell off assets. As last year's frantic merger activity seems to have eased, many companies are focusing their attention on debt- burdened and weakened balance sheets. Concentrating on what they know best, they are selling off non- oil subsidiaries, turning instead to a questionable ''back to basics'' strategy that increases their dependency on weak and uncertain core petroleum businesses.","https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/17/business/big-oil-starts-thinking-smaller.html","","THE Federal Trade Commission last week gave","3","1","1985-03-17T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/2bea1c55-a229-5b6b-89c1-6f48ada97c02",3817,"nyt://article/2bea1c55-a229-5b6b-89c1-6f48ada97c02"

"  WORRIES about the American economy, stemming from the banking crisis in Ohio, have sent the dollar falling, the price of gold climbing, ruined the appetite of foreign investors for United States Government securities and corporate bonds, and pushed up interest rates.   In itself, the magnitude of the threat to the financial system posed by Gov. Richard F. Celeste's closing of 71 Ohio savings and loan institutions appears to have been vastly exaggerated.

"  Plagued by the worst recession in their industry in a generation, American oil and gas producers are sighing with relief at President Reagan's proposal to overhaul the tax system, which would leave their most valuable tax benefits intact.   ''It looks very promising for the industry,'' said George P. Mitchell of Mitchell Energy and Development, a major independent oil and gas producer.

Analysts and others who follow the oil markets said that was the meaning of the surprising statements of anger and frustration expressed by OPEC officials during the group's executive committee meeting last week in Taif, Saudi Arabia.   The situation recalls the crisis that engulfed OPEC last fall, when price cuts by non-OPEC producers forced it to reduce the price for Saudi Arabian Light, its benchmark crude, by $1, to $28 a barrel.   OPEC's latest predicament was underscored by Britain's decision last week to lower by $1.25 a barrel, to $26.65, the price it pays to suppliers for Brent North Sea crude oil. Analysts said that the decision placed great pressure on Nigeria, OPEC's most problematic producer, to cut the price of its premier crude, which competes directly with Brent, and thus constituted a direct challenge to OPEC's internal cohesion.","https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/10/business/opec-s-pricing-predicament.html","","A continuing worldwide oversupply of crude oil, lower oil demand in the second quarter and increased oil production by the industrial nations have combined to precipitate yet another pricing and production crisis for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.","D","1","1985-06-10T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/efe96dae-305a-59ca-8862-4fee5286756d",1451,"nyt://article/efe96dae-305a-59ca-8862-4fee5286756d"

IN the minds of many Americans, Iran stands second only to Vietnam as a disaster for American foreign policy. The fall of the Shah, America's most powerful ally in the vital Persian Gulf region, and the seizure of Americans whom mobs of ''students'' held captive for 15 months, together constituted a national humiliation of formidable proportions. As usual, it has led to a searing domestic debate about who is to blame. Was Jimmy Carter's human rights policy one of the main reasons for the Shah's demise? Could the Carter Administration have done more to stiffen the Shah's backbone and so prevent the triumph of the fanatically anti-American Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini? Should the United States, on the contrary, have put more distance between itself and the doomed Shah, and tried to ingratiate itself with the Iranian opposition? After the Ayatollah's victory, would Washington have been wiser to have denied the Shah's request for medical treatment in the United States? Could the hostages' release have been obtained sooner, by diplomacy or by force? Was the military rescue operation, in April 1980, a close miss or a predictable failure? Should the whole hostage crisis have been played down instead of being allowed to become a masochistic national drama?","https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/16/books/washington-ripe-for-disaster.html","","ALL FALL DOWN America's Tragic Encounter With Iran.

However, in asserting that it can and should be used to replace new centralized power plants, he either overlooks or ignores a few salient points.    * Mandating that utilities purchase co-generated power in lieu of building their own plants will in effect restrict them to future capacity based on oil and gas (the fuels used in industrial boilers), thereby reversing the efforts of utilities to move away from those expensive fuels. Although oil and gas are at present abundant and relatively stable in price, is it wise to assume that those conditions will continue indefinitely, and prevent the utilities from adding coal- and nuclear-generated capacity?","https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/10/opinion/l-letter-on-electric-power-co-generation-has-its-limits-110045.html","","To the Editor:","A","22","1985-07-10T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/0d8c0dae-23e5-525a-a674-1ae277c811f6",418,"nyt://article/0d8c0dae-23e5-525a-a674-1ae277c811f6"

"  By cutting its oil prices late Wednesday, Mexico took on the reluctant role of an industry price leader, compelled to act as it lost markets to OPEC discounters, petroleum specialists said here today.   The price cut by the largest foreign supplier of oil to the United States adds significantly to the downward momentum in worldwide oil prices, analysts said, and puts increased pressure on OPEC to take some decisive action when it meets on July 22.   The stocks of most major oil companies fell in response to the news and the spot-market prices of crude oil from other parts of the world also posted declines.

"  To the Editor:   ''The Oil Glut's Not for Gloating'' (editorial July 9) is to be commended for taking the long view of the current oil glut and our (understandable) fascination with OPEC's woes. However, in calling for more oil exploration (essential) and fattening the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, you overlook a more basic and ultimately more effective policy: replacing oil with other fuels.   The trends have been in the right direction. Over the last five years, all new domestic energy supplies have come from nuclear (27 percent) and coal (37 percent), respectively, with about 7 percent from ''alternative'' sources. In fact, over one-third of all the world's new energy supplies came from nuclear sources over the last five years. That the increases in supply were smaller than they might have been, absent conservation, is obvious; equally obvious, however, is that new non-oil energy supplies are needed. Considering that the U.S. has more coal and uranium than any other nation, and only 4 percent of world oil reserves (the Middle East has 60 percent), the path we should be taking seems clear.","https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/29/opinion/l-letter-on-energy-resources-look-to-replacing-oil-despite-glut-153541.html","","To the Editor:","A","14","1985-07-29T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/ef634c35-70d4-5f22-a3df-413d0d135661",372,"nyt://article/ef634c35-70d4-5f22-a3df-413d0d135661"

"  To the Editor:   Leonard Silk (''How to Soften the Dollar Landing,'' column, July 26) reports that the conventional wisdom of economists urges a reduction in the $150 billion trade deficit by a soft landing (i.e., a not-too-rapid dollar devaluation of perhaps 20 percent) plus a significant reduction in the $200 billion Government fiscal deficit. But even a soft landing, devaluation and indiscriminate budget-deficit reduction may cause more harm than good.   First, as The Economist (July 19) reported, more than half the United States trade deficit comes from trading with non-oil-exporting Latin American and Asian countries whose currency is tied to the dollar ($22 billion), plus oil imports ($55 billion), whose price is also fixed in dollars. Hence a devaluation of the dollar will not increase competitiveness in these areas; moreover, it would hurt the export earnings of Latin American countries that already have difficulty paying their debts to U.S. banks.","https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/09/opinion/l-hard-thinking-on-a-soft-landing-for-the-dollar-178325.html","","To the Editor:","A","26","1985-08-09T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/6348efd5-c7a7-526f-8319-2206b680ae7c",626,"nyt://article/6348efd5-c7a7-526f-8319-2206b680ae7c"

She expects starts of single and multifamily housing units to total 1.85 million for 1985, solidly ahead of last year's 1.75 million units. The September number, due out next week, will show the housing sector's growing strength, said Mrs. Cahn. She expects a 6 percent jump in starts over the August level, the second strong monthly rise in a row. Michael Carey, of Citicorp Investment Bank, is also optimistic about this key sector. ''We expect housing starts to continue to rise through the fourth quarter,'' he said, as lower mortgage rates and gains in real personal income encourage home building and buying.","3","1","1985-10-06T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/1f944c77-4d57-551c-a818-26344f8e46c7",581,"nyt://article/1f944c77-4d57-551c-a818-26344f8e46c7"

"SAUDI ARABIA The Ceaseless Quest for Security. By Nadav Safran. 524 pp. Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. $25.

SAUDI ARABIA is an improbable nation - a meager population of perhaps seven or eight million, more than one-third of them foreign workers, living in a vast, indefensible area under whose barren deserts lie the world's largest reserves of easily accessible oil, and with a unique political system held together by Islamic tradition and a royal family several thousand strong. The reality is difficult to describe accurately. What has been presented to American readers is often deeply colored by the views and purposes of the presenter, who may be driven by the idea of building barriers against the Russians, intent on the need for Saudi oil (and thus for Saudi friendship) at almost any cost, worried about the security of Israel being threatened by Arab armies and terrorists backed by Saudi wealth, or merely desirous of titillating a reader's fancy with tales of this strange society of millionaires one step removed from the nomad's tent.","https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/06/books/indecision-in-the-desert.html","SAUDI ARABIA The Ceaseless Quest for Security.

"  More than a million migrant Arabs working in countries throughout the Middle East are being forced to return home, in large part because of the end of the decadelong oil boom.   The development, which is bringing to an end the largest Arab migration in modern Middle Eastern history, holds potentially grave consequences for economic and political stability and United States interests in the region, according to Arab and American officials and diplomats and experts on migration and politics in nine Middle Eastern countries.   These sources said that the projected return home of 1 million to 1.5 million migrant workers by the end of 1986 and a sharp decline in the money the workers send home would be of particular concern in the region's poorer countries, including Egypt and Jordan.   Officials said they were also concerned that large numbers of frustrated, unemployed workers who once enjoyed high incomes and even higher expectations may be increasingly drawn to Islamic fundamentalism or other forms of political extremism.      Threat to Allies Is Seen    A study completed last summer by the Central Intelligence Agency concluded that the return of hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers to their home countries posed a particular threat to the stability of United States allies in the region - Egypt, Jordan, the Sudan and Yemen, all of which have been major exporters of labor to the Persian Gulf.","https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/06/world/wave-of-arab-migration-ending-with-oil-boom.html","","More than a million migrant Arabs working in countries throughout the Middle East are being forced to return home, in large part because of the end of the decadelong oil boom.","1","1","1985-10-06T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/df769cfb-cd37-53ea-b666-0b9a79cdbe79",2389,"nyt://article/df769cfb-cd37-53ea-b666-0b9a79cdbe79"

"  SELDOM do the highly paid professionals who make a living on Wall Street by predicting the twists and turns of the stock market admit to being stumped.   But confused over the economic outlook, the pros have thrown up their hands and resorted to picking stocks like small-time investors - with a lot of guesswork.   If business growth improves from the sluggish levels experienced in the second half of 1985, Wall Street will gravitate toward the high-risk, and therefore higher reward investments in the coming year, such as high-technology stocks. But if the economy slumps further, or perhaps slips into a recession, the safest place to be is in utilities and companies in other industries where products are essential in good times or bad.   ''The $64,000 question is whether the economy will rebound a bit, as I think the consensus is expecting, or will it slip into a recession,'' Cornelia Small, managing director of Scudder Stevens & Clark, a Wall Street money manager, said. Miss Small, whose firm handles $12 billion in assets in a dozen mutual funds, pension funds and personal accounts, is currently taking a cautious road, as are many investment experts. ''We diversify.

"  ARE the strains that have been hurting the Texas economy temporary or do they signify lasting troubles for the state? And, if so, what can be done about them?   A new study by Bernard L. Weinstein, a professor at Southern Methodist University who serves as chairman of Gov. Mark White's Economic Advisory Council, and his S.M.U. colleague, Harold T. Gross, finds that changes in world trade patterns have been the major cause of job and income losses for Texas's three ''basic'' industries - energy, high tech and agriculture.   And they believe that the implications of structural change in those areas will continue to have ''severe implications'' for the overall health of the Texas economy. They find that virtually all of Texas's recent industrial job losses are directly or indirectly a result of such developments as falling oil prices, Japanese semiconductor competition and the effect of the strong dollar on export commodities. Since April 1981, Texas has lost nearly 120,000 jobs in mining, manufacturing and transportation, most of them related to contraction in the energy sector.","https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/27/business/economic-scene-testing-time-for-texans.html","","ARE the strains that have been hurting the Texas economy temporary or do they signify lasting troubles for the state?

"  EACH month's inflation news suggests our new environment of low inflation has staying power. But how long can it continue?  Right now, the dollar's decline since last winter is causing concern that inflation may reignite - a lower dollar could mean a rise in the price of imported raw materials and finished goods, and corresponding price increases in similar domestic products. This concern assumes that the dollar will continue to fall and that the inflationary response will be symmetrical to its response when the dollar was rising. Such symmetry has occurred in the past. But a symmetrical response is not likely this time, nor is the dollar likely to retrace its rise and give up the 87 percent it gained over the five-year period that ended last winter.   The world economy differs from that of five years ago in two important respects. First, there is a surfeit of agricultural, energy and other industrial commodities. Second, the strong dollar promoted the development of substantial manufacturing capacity in the Far East, particularly among the newly industrialized countries of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. As a result, these exporters have an excess supply of commodities and, thus, are not likely to risk losing their market shares in the United States by raising prices.","https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/01/business/why-the-lid-is-on-prices-at-last.html","","EACH month's inflation news suggests our new environment of low inflation has staying power.

"  AS 1986 rolls in, we all have something to be thankful for: OPEC is history. And as the cartel crumbles, it is becoming clear that it never really controlled the world crude oil market. Rather, market forces were the dominant factor all along, although this was obscured by events.   This observation is borne out by recent developments. Earlier this month, OPEC announced a new policy of maintaining a ''fair share'' of the market, regardless of the price cuts needed to achieve this.

Since then,he has forcibly sought to remake Libyan society according to his own revolutionary precepts.   Qaddafi's ambitions are not confined within Libya's borders, however. He fancies himself a leader and agent of historic forces that will reorder third-world politics to his taste. His vision provides both a motive and a rationale for providing military and financial aid to radical regimes, and for undermining moderate governments by supporting - or manufacturing - subversive groups and abetting terrorists.   Qaddafi's aggressive policies increasingly have focused on undermining U.S. and other Western interests in the third world as he sees these as the main barrier to his radical and expansionist goals.

Oil has become a commodity like any other, and the price changes of recent weeks are part of a pattern of volatility that will characterize the market in the future.   With the advantage of hindsight, we can see rather clearly how the seeds of OPEC's destruction were planted years ago. OPEC managers (and most of the rest of us) seriously underestimated the speed with which the industrial economies could adapt through investment in more energy-efficient dwellings, cars and industrial machinery. And few predicted the increased flow of non-OPEC oil from a price-induced drilling boom. As a result, the cartel overshot badly in setting crude prices, particularly in the months following the Iranian revolution, in late 1978 and 1979.   It was downhill from there, with a reduction in the total market and a drastic cut in OPEC's share. OPEC's production is now around 18 million barrels a day, and it needs to be cut another 2 million or so to match weakening demand. A decade ago, capacity totaled more than 30 million barrels a day. Today, even with the ravages of the Iran-Iraq war and the rundown of capacity in places like Kuwait, OPEC countries still could produce 40 percent to 50 percent more than they do now.","https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/26/business/the-market-takes-control-a-shock-that-opec-won-t-overcome.html","","IN THE 1970's, economists debated whether the oil market was fundamentally different from other commodities markets.

"  After a decade of fairy-tale riches, Saudi Arabia saw its oil revenues dwindle in the last three years by more than two-thirds as it cut production in a vain attempt to mop up a world oil surplus and bolster prices set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   The failure of that strategy prompted the Saudis to try a new tack recently - a sharp increase in production, which sent oil prices tumbling last week - in an effort to escape a deepening recession that is worrying their country's powerful business community.   Once a byword for opulence and extravagant spending, Saudi Arabia saw its oil revenues fall from a peak of about $110 billion in 1980 to $26 billion last year as the desert kingdom reduced its exports to about 1.3 million barrels a day - less than half its official OPEC quota. The result has been a steady deterioration in the Saudi business climate since the oil revenue cuts started to be felt in 1983, according to Western bankers, businessmen and analysts.

"  THIS is shaping up as an excellent year for bashing the Federal Reserve Board.   Cuts in the deficit, mandated by the Gramm-Rudman statute, will amount to about $11 billion between March and September 1986, and about $60 billion the following year. Accordingly, a growing chorus of politicians and economists is calling on the Fed to ''accommodate'' the cuts with an expansive monetary policy.   But the degree of monetary stimulus needed to offset cuts of this magnitude would lead to a sharp reacceleration of inflation. At the same time, a more restrictive policy than the present money-growth rate of about 12 percent combined with the contractionary effect of large deficit cuts could throw the economy into a recession.

Given the protectionist sentiment in Congress and the widening trade gap, Japanese officials apparently felt that extending the quotas would indicate good intentions, at some cost to Japanese auto makers who seek more sales in the United States. But Congressional leaders and the Administration say that Japan should open its markets to American products rather than restrict sales here.   Higher car prices could result from the quotas, some analysts said, as the supply of Japanese cars falls short of demand.

"THE continuing plunge in oil prices - so favorable for Japan and unfavorable for the United States - threatens to crash the dollar and worsen economic and financial relations between Tokyo and Washington. Properly handled, however, falling oil prices could sharply improve relations.

The current surge of the yen - up 32 percent since last September - reflects a recognition that Japan has the most to gain from the precipitous drop in oil prices. As the world's largest oil importer, Japan relies on overseas supplies for virtually all of its oil and about 82 percent of its total energy needs. If crude prices average from $14 to $18 a barrel in 1986, Japan will save between $15 billion and $20 billion in oil imports alone, and more in coal and other energy imports. If exports and non-energy imports remain unchanged, Japan's trade surplus will rise from $56 billion in 1985 to about $75 billion in 1986.

Simply put, Japan could become the new OPEC of the world financial system, sucking in money from abroad through its powerful export industries and spending even less abroad because of falling oil prices.","https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/16/business/a-new-strain-on-relations-with-japan.html","THE continuing plunge in oil prices - so favorable for Japan and unfavorable for the United States - threatens to crash the dollar and worsen economic and financial relations between Tokyo and Washington.

As they acknowledge, such price hikes on the one-third of our oil that is imported will quickly spread to domestic oil and other fuels.

While there is good reason to be pleased with lower oil prices, two critical aspects of the global oil situation have been given short shrift.   First, a major reason for the problems of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is that many non-oil-producing nations decided a decade ago to build nuclear power plants to replace oil. Last year, the world got almost as much energy from nuclear power as was produced by North Sea and Mexican oil fields combined. Nuclear power has caused a permanent loss of six million barrels a day of oil for OPEC - or put another way, it has meant that some oil-importing nations have been able to avoid purchasing over $50 billion a year in oil imports in just one year. Enough nuclear plants are in the ''pipeline'' to replace $15 billion a year more in oil imports.","https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/19/opinion/l-smaller-broader-tax-is-preferable-to-oil-import-fee-991786.html","","To the Editor:","A","22","1986-02-19T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/8ebbb9d4-fdee-5354-af04-b3729615cfd2",324,"nyt://article/8ebbb9d4-fdee-5354-af04-b3729615cfd2"

As a result, few analysts expect the Administration to take any steps to intervene, such as by imposing an oil import fee.

"  Most developing nations that import oil will gain more from the impact of falling oil prices on the industrialized world than from direct savings on their own fuel costs, bankers and economists say in assessing the effects of the price slump on the developing countries.   ''The real issue is the impact of the price cuts on the growth rates in the industrial world and on interest rates,'' said Christine Bindert, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. who has worked as an economic adviser for several Latin American governments.   To be sure, developing nations -just like the United States and other industrialized countries - cannot know just how much they will benefit from falling oil prices until they see how far the price decline goes and how long it lasts.

''We've had a big rally, and some people want to take profits before the economic numbers tomorrow and Friday, and the OPEC meeting this weekend; it's that simple,'' said one Treasury note trader, who asked not to be identified.   Besides the desire of speculators to sell securities on which they have earned huge profits recently, some analysts noted that increases in oil prices the past three trading sessions might have dampened the ardor of those who expect continued increases in bond prices and declines in yields.   They added that bond prices are vulnerable to further declines if the Commerce Department announces an increase in February's retail sales this morning; a decline is widely anticipated.","https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/13/business/credit-markets-interest-rates-up-slightly.html","","After falling sharply in recent sessions, interest rates on short- and long-term securities rose slightly yesterday.","D","16","1986-03-13T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/e0297be3-ceb7-550a-ad47-2b89a75d12fe",803,"nyt://article/e0297be3-ceb7-550a-ad47-2b89a75d12fe"
"  This weekend's emergency session of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva is expected to be dominated by a bitter dispute between Saudi Arabia, the group's most powerful and influential producer, and an alliance of African members supported by Iran.   The 13-member group has been operating since December under the Saudi strategy of unrestrained production to depress prices and win a larger worldwide market share for its oil.   But Algeria and Libya, with the support of tiny Gabon and some non-OPEC nations in Africa, such as Angola, have grown increasingly restive, as dwindling oil prices wipe out badly needed revenues.   This week Nigeria added its voice to the dissidents. Its oil minister, Rilwanu Lukman, said he would join other African states in urging production restraint as a means of working toward average prices of $22 or $23 a barrel. Crude prices have plummeted more than 50 percent since late last year, to below $15 a barrel.","https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/15/business/opec-ministers-to-meet-amid-growing-dispute.html","","This weekend's emergency session of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva is expected to be dominated by a bitter dispute between Saudi Arabia, the group's most powerful and influential producer, and an alliance of African members supported by Iran.","1","33","1986-03-15T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/38a0efbb-50e0-5fa6-83a8-5cfe3ae509db",809,"nyt://article/38a0efbb-50e0-5fa6-83a8-5cfe3ae509db"
"  The Economy    The Producer Price Index had its biggest one-month drop since it began being compiled in 1947. The inflation gauge tumbled 1.6 percent in February, largely from the decline in oil and gasoline prices. The drop was much steeper than expected and put the index for finished goods below its February 1985 level. Analysts said that, for now and the forseeable future, there is an absence of inflation in the American economy.

"  The Administration's decision to seek oil price stability from Saudi Arabia has sharply refocused national attention on the benefits and liabilities of falling oil prices and underscored the high political stakes involved.   While still proclaiming the virtues of the free market, the Administration is sending Vice President Bush to Saudi Arabia Thursday with a mission to persuade the dominant member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that it should take action to stabilize - or even increase - the price of oil by cutting production. Worry Over Economic Damage    Now that prices have fallen as low as $10 a barrel on spot markets, the Administration has become worried about the economic damage that could result domestically, especially in Mr. Bush's adopted state of Texas and other oil-producing states.   The debate about economics and national security leads in turn to politics - Mr. Bush's hopes of winning the Presidency in 1988. The Vice President's public warning Tuesday about the danger of ''a continued free fall'' in oil prices was not the first time he was perceived as linking his own political fortunes to the prosperity of the oil industry.

"  The plunge in the price of oil has thrust Vice President Bush into a delicate and potentially damaging political situation.   While consumers are enjoying lower gasoline prices at the pump and the economy for the most part is benefiting from cheap oil, Mr. Bush is preparing to embark on a four-nation trip to the Middle East to, among other things, express the Administration's concern to Saudi Arabia about the effects of plummeting oil prices on the domestic oil industry.   Mr. Bush, who was an oilman before he entered politics and Government service, said he would tell the Saudis that a strong American oil industry was ''in the national security interests, vital interests of this country.'' Shift in Policy    The Vice President's trip also underscores the fundamental shift that has taken place in Federal energy policy. The Carter Administration's policy was largely concerned with holding down gasoline and heating oil prices. But the Reagan Administration's policy has been oriented toward maintaining the vitality of the oil industry, with Mr. Bush himself intervening in the Administration's tax plan to preserve key write-offs for the oil industry.","https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/03/business/bush-trip-holds-political-consequences.html","","The plunge in the price of oil has thrust Vice President Bush into a delicate and potentially damaging political situation.","D","7","1986-04-03T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/6450bb18-3c8c-59d0-abc6-face3286ee79",866,"nyt://article/6450bb18-3c8c-59d0-abc6-face3286ee79"

The proposal, which faces debate before the full Senate, is much different from the depreciation rules approved by the House last year.

"  Despite the continuing surplus of crude oil in the world, oil industry analysts and officials predict that retail gasoline prices in the United States will increase during the peak summer driving season.   George Keller, chairman of the Chevron Corporation, the nation's fourth-largest oil company, said yesterday that retail prices were ''likely'' to rise between 10 and 15 cents a gallon between Memorial Day and Labor Day if crude oil prices continue to move up as they have this week and demand continues to surge. That would bring the price of gas back to about $1 a gallon, still 20 cents below where it was at the beginning of the year.   Other industry experts, including several oil company officials, however, expect the increases to be more modest, in part because of the competitive nature of the retail gasoline business and also, they say, because projections of a dramatic rise in road travel are too optimistic. Inventories Have Fallen    The major reason for the consensus that prices will rise is that gasoline inventories of American refiners are at 206.3 million barrels, 7 million barrels below what they were last year at this time. That is a level that William L. Randol, vice president of research at the First Boston Corporation, said is the lowest in at least eight years.","https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/10/business/gasoline-price-rise-is-forecast.html","","Despite the continuing surplus of crude oil in the world, oil industry analysts and officials predict that retail gasoline prices in the United States will increase during the peak summer driving season.","1","35","1986-05-10T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/51373dac-5671-5704-8246-17e79ae5114e",1263,"nyt://article/51373dac-5671-5704-8246-17e79ae5114e"

"  PREDICTING the stock market in coming months comes down to figuring out whether the declining oil prices and interest rates that have sent stock prices to record heights will prevail, the experts say.   The combination of the tumbling price of oil that is helping to keep inflation low and reduced borrowing costs that are expected to stimulate economic activity is largely responsible for the rally that has left Wall Street giddy with delight, market watchers believe.   If these conditions continue, many experts are now predicting that the Dow, which climbed nearly 500 points between Sept. 3, when it stood at 1,329.19, and early May, will eventually move well over 2,000. Just when that will happen, however, is a point of dispute.

AN EBONY 9-MILLIMETER SMITH & WESSON model 469 automatic lay amid the clutter on the dressing table - a selection of collar pins, a Sulka tie, the gold Rolex he had picked up on his last trip to Geneva. Curling his right index finger, he whipped the dark tie around his collar and executed a perfect Windsor knot. The tie looked right with the impeccable three-piece suit, discreet, but imparting a special air of authority. He quickly strapped the gun to his right leg, snapped the Rolex around his wrist, grabbed a slim leather briefcase and headed out the apartment door.

Retail gasoline prices had risen steadily through the late spring after falling to about 90 cents a gallon in late April. Today, at less than $1 a gallon, prices remain about 28 cents a gallon below the level of a year ago.

At stake over the short term are continued low oil prices. But over the long term, the results of the conference could have much to do with doubts that are spreading about the economic risks involved in cheap oil, and how they overlap into questions of political decision-making.   Just as the major industrialized nations that are net importers of their energy sources, such as Japan and West Germany - with responsibility for pulling ahead many of the marginal economies of Asia and Western Europe - were beginning to relish the idea of a $10 barrel of crude oil, some of the economic assumptions deriving from the new price arrangement seemed threatened.","https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/25/business/economic-scene-negative-effect-of-cheap-oil.html","","MINISTERS of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will gather on Monday in Geneva to continue a search for means to stabilize oil prices, with little indication that they are any closer to agreement than they were during three earlier attempts this year.","D","2","1986-07-25T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/ae228687-e743-588d-881f-a38b592b3ea7",896,"nyt://article/ae228687-e743-588d-881f-a38b592b3ea7"

The credit markets' fears about weak Japanese demand for the $9.5 billion in 10-year notes auctioned yesterday proved to be well founded despite predictions earlier in the week that the 10-year issue would be highly favored by Japanese investors.

Dealers estimated that Japanese investors purchased between $1 billion and $2 billion of the 10-year notes, or about half of the amount they are estimated to have bought at the previous sale.

"  Fear of Inflation    Last week, reports of an OPEC pact to curtail output raised oil prices on world markets - and the specter of renewed inflation. But even without the oil factor, economists have been worrying about inflationary pressures. Most responding to a recent survey by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, of Sedona, Ariz., said it was their top economic concern. On average, they see the Consumer Price Index rising at higher annual rates - up to 3.9 percent in second-quarter 1987, compared with 1.5 percent in this year's second quarter.   Victor Zarnowitz, a University of Chicago economist, is less worried, but agrees that inflation is likely to rise. A rise in food prices and in the cost of services - especially health services - he says, may put the C.P.I.'s annual growth rate at 2.6 percent this quarter and at 3.4 percent by the fourth quarter.","https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/10/business/prospects.html","","Fear of Inflation","3","1","1986-08-10T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/2bc3f5d1-160e-51f2-b3fe-5a6e6e61daa4",750,"nyt://article/2bc3f5d1-160e-51f2-b3fe-5a6e6e61daa4"

"  Higher oil prices, fluctuating between $15 and $20 a barrel for the rest of the year, would spur moderately higher inflation within a matter of months and slower economic growth for 1987 than had been forecast, according to several economists.   Many economists said they had already factored in oil prices averaging close to $15 a year for the second half of the year before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last Monday to a 20 percent production cut for September and October. They would have been forced to alter their forecasts more if oil prices had slipped below $10 a barrel.   Economists noted that the price of West Texas intermediate crude, the American benchmark grade, fell below $11 in late July and probably would have plunged below $8 if OPEC had not agreed on production cuts. Instead it has recovered, trading Friday at $14.85.

"  Labor Day, 1995    Before too long, the holiday that traditionally marks summer's end may mark the end of an era. By Labor Day, 1995, there will be ''a reversal of the baby-boom trend, when wages dropped and it took some young workers years to find jobs,'' says James Smith, labor economist at the Rand Corporation in Los Angeles. That's because the work force, which grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the 1970's and at 1.5 percent so far in the 1980's, is expected to grow at just 1.1 percent until 1995. The slowdown, which reflects a lower national birth rate, will result in 20 percent fewer young people entering the work force in 1995 than in 1975.   Does this mean a labor shortage when the baby-bust generation comes of age? Not over all, says Mr. Smith, who predicts that to lure more workers, companies will pay entry workers about 59 percent of what mature workers earn in 1995, compared with 50 percent in 1980. And, he says, baby-boom-era employees will work longer to qualify for the improved benefits and pension plans the baby-bust generation is expected to force on companies. Meanwhile, automation will help reduce demand for workers. But there may be an acute labor shortage in lower-paying posts, such as cashiers, waiters or janitors, he warns, and to find workers for these and other jobs the nation may have to consider easing immigration restrictions.","https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/31/business/prospects.html","","Labor Day, 1995","3","1","1986-08-31T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/3013da75-56ed-547a-836b-799ff93a4763",757,"nyt://article/3013da75-56ed-547a-836b-799ff93a4763"

"  SOON after Cecil Rhodes showed up on the diamond fields of South Africa in 1871, he seized on the business concept that still drives the diamond industry worldwide: monopoly.   Forsaking prospecting, he bought a steam-powered pump for sucking water from flooded diamond mines. It was the only such pump in South Africa. Faced with severe flooding, the small mine operators soon ran out of cash to pay their sole pump supplier. So they sold their mining claims to Mr. Rhodes, the founder of the De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.   Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, a British diamond trader who emigrated to South Africa and who eventually succeeded Mr. Rhodes as head of De Beers, adopted the same strategy.

"  Inflation, or more precisely the fear of it, nudged itself back into the public consciousness last week, touching off a sharp rise in interest rates that set in motion the record plunge in the stock market.   What is troubling some investors is not so much a clearly defined scenario of how inflation will work its way through the economy but rather a generalized anxiety that higher interest rates and higher prices lie ahead. Most economists say that without falling oil prices, the inflation rate indeed will be higher, but that fears of a 1970's-style surge are unfounded.   Part of the reason financial markets are so sensitive to inflation is the memory of the spiraling 12 and 13 percent price rises that plagued the United States in the late 1970's. To wring out inflation, the Federal Reserve Board pushed interest rates sharply higher, causing the economy to tumble into a steep recession.","https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/16/business/analyzing-the-inflation-jitters.html","","Inflation, or more precisely the fear of it, nudged itself back into the public consciousness last week, touching off a sharp rise in interest rates that set in motion the record plunge in the stock market.","D","1","1986-09-16T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/49c45370-b152-5e9a-a0ea-a6a67f44eeeb",1679,"nyt://article/49c45370-b152-5e9a-a0ea-a6a67f44eeeb"

"  A decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to basically extend its current production agreement is unlikely to cause oil prices to stray out of the $13-to-$16-a-barrel range they have been in since Sept. 1, according to oil analysts in the United States.   OPEC is considering allowing some of its members to raise production enough to add 200,000 barrels a day to the organization's total output, but given that late autumn and early winter is the peak demand period for crude oil, the extra output would probably not put any downward pressure on prices, the analysts said.

WERE there a prize for the most ambitious literary undertaking of the year -and considering how prizes proliferate, there doubtless soon will be - David Halberstam would be an easy winner. ''The Reckoning'' is an attempt, no less, to assess the whole postwar industrial and associated cultural, political and larger economic history of Japan and the United States and the economic competition and conflict that have arisen in consequence. This it does by focusing attention on the histories, over half a century and more, of two great industrial companies and their leaders, participants and larger communities - Ford in the United States and Nissan, the makers of Datsun, in Japan. The word focus, however, could be misleading; Mr. Halberstam's lens is extraordinarily wide. No considerable cultural trait or historical event bearing however marginally on his story escapes his attention. He has, all readers will agree, a highly developed talent for digression.","https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/26/books/when-nissan-had-a-better-idea.html","","THE RECKONING By David Halberstam. 752 pp. New York: William Morrow & Company. $19.95.","7","1","1986-10-26T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/d10a7539-d3fd-5112-9932-55576b924674",1928,"nyt://article/d10a7539-d3fd-5112-9932-55576b924674"

Saudi Arabia, which has been producing oil since 1939, is the world's third-largest producer after the Soviet Union and the United States, and it is believed to have the world's largest oil reserves.

That was the patrician Richard Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange from 1930 to 1935, who was convicted of grand larceny in 1938 (for using other people's stock as collateral for his own loans).

This week, Professor Galbraith -who is preparing a lengthy article on the precarious state of today's capital markets for the Atlantic Monthly magazine - was asked to compare the Whitney scandal of old with Ivan Boesky's unfolding misdeeds and to explore the causes and likely repercussions of the current insider trading case. In a discussion with Kyle Crichton, Business Forum editor, Mr. Galbraith, emeritus professor of economics at Harvard University, finds Mr. Boesky's fall less dramatically pleasing than Mr. Whitney's, but is otherwise optimistic that, by dampening the merger wave, the scandal may prove salutary.

The big event will come sometime in early spring when Mexico, Brazil and Argentina throw in the towel and take the long-feared step of setting up a militant debtor's cartel, reminiscent of OPEC in the 1970's. The Administration and Congress will at first threaten counteraction. But the mood in Washington will shift rapidly. Within weeks, we will join the cartel and, like our neighbors to the south, make debt the centerpiece of our overall economic policy.","https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/28/business/business-forum-who-lost-east-hampton-1987-a-year-we-wont-soon.html","IF you are a corporate executive who resists planning ahead, consider yourself an enemy of America in the competitive world market.

"  OPEC's agreement to slash output by 7 percent in the first half of 1987 sent oil prices above $17 a barrel for the first time since September. OPEC's target is $18 a barrel, but most analysts say the spurt in prices was an overreaction to the OPEC agreement. Reached after two weeks of disharmonious talks led by Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister and the chairman of OPEC, the agreement requires all members except Iraq to cut production. More significantly, it requires them to adhere to a price system for crude products that analysts say will not likely be followed. Other OPEC agreements have failed as members - fearful of losing revenues - cheated on quotas or undercut pricing agreements.   The effect of any increase on heating oil and gasoline prices remains uncertain, however, because those refined products often do not respond until crude prices stabilize. But most analysts expect at least slight increases at the pump, possibly dampening Americans' new-found enthusiasm for driving.","https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/28/business/week-in-business-oil-prices-move-up-at-least-for-now.html","","OPEC's agreement to slash output by 7 percent in the first half of 1987 sent oil prices above $17 a barrel for the first time since September.

While confessing that they did not know how long it would last, both sides agreed that $18-a-barrel oil was good for consumers and producers. So much for the talk. What about the economic realities? First, look at what caused the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to unravel last year. As with all cartels, excess capacity became OPEC's Achilles' heel. To impose artifically high prices, OPEC had to reduce output, leaving it with some excess capacity in the early 1970's. The market force of artificially high prices pushed down world demand by 15 percent from from 1979 through 1985. Also, the supply of oil from the non-OPEC interlopers rose by almost 50 percent from 1973 through 1985. Thus, OPEC had to again dramatically reduce its output - to nearly 50 percent below its peak in 1977, leaving it with even more excess capacity.","3","2","1987-02-08T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/7745327e-4487-5e53-93eb-8acb631b3601",984,"nyt://article/7745327e-4487-5e53-93eb-8acb631b3601"

Traders said a sharp drop in stock index futures caused heavy program selling of stocks in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average nearly recovered fully from a drop of almost 45 points, but a sharp reversal in the final hour left the blue-chip index 18.70 points lower, at 2,216.54. [ Page D1. ] Bank stocks tumbled amid growing investor concern about the earnings impact of the Brazilian move. [ D8. ] The dollar was firmer in light trading. Traders said they were unwilling so far to test the strength of a weekend accord by the United States and five of its allies. The nations pledged to ''cooperate closely'' to stabilize the dollar. In New York, gold dropped $3.25, to $402.50. [ D24. ] In the credit markets, interest rates fell on Treasury issues as a late rally pushed up prices. Dealers and traders remained uncertain on the outlook for the dollar. [ D21. ] Prices of crude oil slumped to their lowest levels since the OPEC production-restraint accord took effect Jan. 1. In New York futures trading, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude fell 56 cents, to $17.08 a barrel. [ D24. ] Kidder, Peabody was fined $300,000 by the New York Stock Exchange, which charged that the firm violated exchange rules and Federal regulations. According to the exchange, the violations included improperly computing net capital and filing inaccurate reports to the Government. [ D5. ] THE ECONOMY The U. S. and the Soviet Union resumed grain talks amid reports that Moscow had recently bought up to a million tons of American corn. Moscow's re-entry into the market would reaffirm a long-term bilateral grain agreement. Senior American officials were saying just a month ago that the pact had been virtually repudiated by the Russians. [ D6. ] The Supreme Court agreed to clarify the circumstances in which companies must publicly disclose merger talks. It will also hear a case about nuclear plants that exceed cost projections. [ D5. ] COMPANIES Rainier said it received two takeover proposals from large out-of-state banking companies. Rainier, the largest bank in the state of Washington, did not identify the suitors. But banking sources said the suitors were probably Security Pacific and First Bank System. Both bids involve exchanges of stock. [ D1. ] Sumner M. Redstone stepped up the bidding battle for Viacom. A company controlled by Mr. Redstone offered about $2.5 billion for just over 80 percent of Viacom, with the promise of a greater cash payout. The bid for the media concern exceeds a previous Redstone bid and a management buyout offer. [ D1. ] The parent of American Airlines ruled out a bid for Pan Am. AMR said, however, that it would be interested in acquiring assets of Pan Am if they were put on the market. [ D6. ] Elders IXL plans to acquire Carling O'Keefe, the Canadian brewer, for almost $300 million. [ D5. ] Conoco plans a $400 million project involving an offshore production platform in extremely deep waters. [ D5. ] INTERNATIONAL Argentina is seeking new money and concessions sufficient to insure 4 percent economic growth, officials said. The nation is preparing to open debt talks with private banks in New York. Argentina is doing considerably better than Brazil, which has suspended interest payments on debt to foreign commercial banks, but it faces such problems as inflation. [ D8. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS The outlook for nonrefundable, discounted air fares remains in doubt. Passenger volume has risen strongly, but Christopher D. Bowers, a marketing executive at United, is uneasy about the loss of revenues. Talking Business. [ D2. ] Single-country funds are still in vogue after gaining immense popularity last year.

Texaco stock was the day's most-active issue, dropping $3.375, to $28.50, on volume of 12.6 million shares, and Texaco bonds fell in lighter trading. Meanwhile, the shares of its rival, Pennzoil, plunged $15.25, to $77, amid uncertainty about how much the company might eventually collect from its high-stakes legal battle with Texaco. [ Page D1. ] Pennzoil's rejection of a $2 billion settlement with Texaco was probably a historic gamble, and many analysts feel it has lost an important bargaining chip. [ D1. ] Pennzoil is unlikely to succeed if it tries to challenge Texaco's bankruptcy filing, lawyers and bankruptcy experts said. [ D5. ] I.B.M. reported a surprising rise in first-quarter revenues, though net income dropped 23 percent, to $785 million. The results were far better than most analysts had predicted, and I.B.M. stock surged $2.625, to $147.625, amid hopes that a flood of new products later this year will pull I.B.M. out of a two-year slump. [ D1. ] The head of the troubled Mellon Bank resigned. There were indications that J. David Barnes, chairman and chief executive, had been forced out, and analysts speculated that the move was largely at the urging of the Mellon family. [ D1. ] Merrill Lynch's earnings increased 25 percent, and revenues grew similarly. Merrill, the first brokerage house to report results of a buoyant first quarter, was hurt by rising costs but helped by the new tax law. [ D23. ] Chemical and Irving Trust reported lower earnings, citing the change in the status of their Brazilian loans. While Wells Fargo also put its Brazilian loans on a cash basis, it reported higher earnings, helped by its Crocker acquisition.

The clashes were the most ferocious in a week. 1 The South Korean protesters's goal is freedom, supporters said. In the Seoul neighborhood of Yongdungpo, the ferment of recent weeks has drawn the interest and emotions of many working-class residents. 3 A U.S. official expressed optimism about the situation in South Korea, saying President Chun Doo Hwan was amenable to changes. The State Department official, Gaston J. Sigur Jr., conferred with Mr. Chun this week. 3 William J.

The apparent agreement is a victory for Iran, which wants to maximize prices, and a defeat for Saudi Arabia. 35 The trade status of Rumania was suspended.

The Court's balancer and compromiser, he is creating, through retirement, a particular void, in tone as well as substance. 32 In a victory for property owners, the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, sharply limited the power of governments to force landowners to surrender ownership rights without them compensation. 33 The President had polyps removed from his colon at a medical checkup.

The result was far worse than analysts had expected and caused turmoil in the financial markets. The dollar fell to record lows against the yen and the mark, bond prices rose steeply and stocks fell. Imports of cars and oil contributed to the growing deficit. Many economists said they were more concerned about the slow rise of U.S. exports than by the increase in imports. The trade figures prompted fresh appeals by Democrats and organized labor for passage early in the new year of the trade bill pending in a Senate-House conference committee. The Reagan Administration acknowledged a setback but insisted that the figures were not as grim as they appeared. [ Page A1. ] Florida's Legislature repealed the tax on advertising and professional services, and Governor Martinez said he would sign the bill today. Many corporations and advertising agencies that had led the fight against the tax said the repeal would discourage other states from following Florida's attempt to tax services. The Legislature also raised the general sales tax to 6 percent, from 5 percent, to maintain revenues at current levels. [ A1. ] The Senate gave final approval to a deficit reduction package that includes $9 billion in tax increases. The package would put into effect a major portion of the budget compromise reached by Congressional and Administration negotiators last month. [ A27. ] Three men were convicted of tax fraud in what Federal officials said was the largest tax fraud case ever filed. They included Charles A. Atkins, sometimes known as ''the boy wonder of tax shelters.'' A Federal District Court jury in Manhattan found Mr. Atkins guilty of 28 counts of conspiracy and fraud.

[ D1. ] INTERNATIONAL The Federal Reserve and 11 foreign central banks reached a preliminary accord to increase the required capital base of banks. The accord is part of a two-year effort by the Fed and other American regulators to force higher capital cushions on banks that are taking greater risks in lending. It also reflects the global trend of closer coordination of regulatory policies. [ A1. ] OPEC suspended deliberations to allow mediation of the sharply divergent views of Iran and Iraq on production policies. But prospects of reconciliation appeared dim. [ D1. ] Mikhail S. Gorbachev asked American business for help in improving the economic relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, now that political tensions have eased. [ A22. ] MARKETS The dollar plummeted to its lowest levels since the 1940's amid heavy trading as dealers sold the currency in the wake of the unexpectedly bad report on the nation's trade deficit. Gold rose to its highest level in nearly five years, reaching $492.30 an ounce, up $7.80, on the New York Commodity Exchange. [ D1. ] Stock prices closed sharply lower after a seesaw session that reflected the bad news on the trade front. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 47.08 points, or 2.47 percent, to 1,855.44.

The rally helped cut the yield on the bellwether long-term bond to 8.68 percent, from 8.79 percent the previous day. A good part of the gain was attributed to buying by short-sellers. [ 40. ] The dollar drifted lower while the British pound held its ground, despite cuts in British interest rates.

The increase was led by a 14.7 percent annualized rise in the amount of money borrowed to buy automobiles.

The $109-a-share offer was accepted by a special committee of RJR Nabisco board after a frenzied round of bidding between Kohlberg, Kravis and a group led by RJR Nabisco's top executives. The management group bitterly complained that it had made a better offer - one it valued at $25.42 billion - but that it had been cheated by an unfair bidding process. The group hinted it might try to challenge the outcome. The deal will involve enormous debt, and Kolhlberg, Kravis executives said that to help pay off the loans they hoped to raise as much as $6 billion in the next few years by selling some RJR Nabisco food businesses. For shareholders, the Kohlberg, Kravis offer is about double the $55 that the shares were selling for before the takeover battle began. But the shares traded in the low $90's during the week, indicating some uneasiness with the record deal that may take months to complete. *","3","12","1988-12-04T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/88edcf70-ffd0-5f74-a830-046a236f7d4e",1035,"nyt://article/88edcf70-ffd0-5f74-a830-046a236f7d4e"

Canadians may find bargains in skis, furniture, computers and telephone handsets under the tariff cuts that took effect at midnight on Dec. 31. Duties are being reduced or eliminated in more than 8,000 categories - the start of a 10-year process that will end practically all trade barriers between the countries, freeing investment and strengthening ties. [ Page 29. ] Debt swaps are coming under fire in Latin countries. This method of reducing the region's payments - through conversion of debt into equity - is said to swell the money supply in countries already struggling with triple-digit inflation. Another complaint is that it expands foreign control of local economies without significantly increasing investment. [ 29. ] OPEC appeared ready to curb oil production under an agreement aimed at raising prices by cutting output nearly 20 percent. But experts said prices would probably stay below $15 a barrel because of high levels of supply. The accord, which would limit production of the 13 OPEC members to 18.5 million barrels a day for six months, took effect yesterday. [ 29. ] U.S. stock markets were again outperformed in 1988 by their counterparts abroad. Out of 20 countries, the United States ranked 12th when return is measured in dollar terms, outdone by Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Japan, France, Australia, Singapore/ Malaysia, Hong Kong, West Germany and Canada.

[ 10. ] The new Banking Committee chairmen are a study in contrasts. Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the 15-term Democrat from San Antonio, is the House eccentric, ardent populist and the first Hispanic person to be elected to Congress. Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., a three-term Democrat from Michigan, with business training from Harvard, is deliberative and serious. [ 12. ] COMPANIES Airline profits in the United States are soaring to their highest level since the industry was deregulated 10 years ago. Behind the boom are higher air fares and modest growth in traffic. [ 29. ] Detroit is preparing an expanded auto show that it hopes will burnish its faded image as the international leader in car manufacturing. The show, which opens Saturday, will include the introduction of several new models by domestic and foreign makers. [ 29. ] San Diego officials oppose the bid by a utility company in Los Angeles to acquire San Diego Gas and Electric. [ 29. ] THE MEDIA BUSINESS New varieties of video news releases worry some experts on journalism. Concerned about the quality and ethics of television news, they think this technique used to convey corporate views represents a dangerous blurring of news and advertising. Television.

The prime, which is a benchmark banks use to set rates on borrowing by individuals and smaller businesses, had been rising steadily for more than a year. In May 1988, the prime was 8.5 percent.

That was in line with expectations and was seen as a further indication that the nation's sharply slower economic growth is unlikely to deteriorate into a recession. Five of the index's 11 components contributed to the increase, led by a rise in manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials. [ 33. ] Farmers received 0.7 percent more for raw products in December than in November, the Agriculture Department said.

[ 41. ] COMPANIES Antonovich Inc. has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The move by the New York-area fur retailer follows the announcement by a competitor, Fur Vault, that it would sell its unprofitable retail operations. Fur retailers face new competition from foreign companies, like Jindo of Korea, and are under pressure from animal rights groups. [ 33. ] Some airlines are seriously considering raising fares or adding ticket surcharges to offset higher fuel prices, people in the industry say. The moves could come just before the time of year when carriers generally cut their fares.
