"On October 31, Murray Adelman, professor of economics emeritus at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology and a specialist on the economics of oil, submitted written testimony to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs on oil price volatility. 

In his testimony, Mr. Adelman asserted the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, including Saudi Arabia, have been following a short-term profit-maximizing strategy by raising prices as high as the market will bear. ""The OPEC nations are dependent on only one industry. They also face military-political risks,"" Mr. Adelman testified. ""In economic theory, they should grab for short-time gains and neglect long-term penalties. They have acted by the book: raising prices too high, and quickly overspending revenue.""

Mr. Adelman testified that OPEC would exhaust its gains from the price rises after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. ""The OPEC account went from a huge surplus in 1974 to zero in 1978. The bigger surplus of 1980 went negative in only two years. The surplus of 1990 will also vanish,"" he wrote.

"  AT the reunion in Vienna this week of the 13 members of OPEC, with the Iraqi and Kuwaiti representatives sitting grimly next to each other as the alphabet dictated, agreement was reached to restore OPEC's pre-invasion production limit of 22.5 million barrels a day and to reaffirm the target price of about $21 a barrel once the Persian Gulf crisis is over. And while the meeting was going on, the price of oil fell to $25.35 a barrel, the lowest since Aug. 3, the day after the invasion began. Though it rose yesterday, to $26.42, that is still nearly $15 below the Oct. 10 peak of $41.15.    Does the market know something the rest of us do not -- that there will be no war? No one can be sure. Administration spokesmen stress the importance of destroying the power of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to dominate the oil market and destabilize the American and world economies. As President Bush put the case two weeks after the invasion: ""Our jobs, our way of life, our own freedom and the freedom of friendly countries around the world would all suffer if control of the world's great oil reserves fell into the hands of Saddam Hussein.""    Oil evidently remains a powerful cause of war, as it has been throughout modern history. ""The fierce and sometimes violent quest for oil -- and for the riches and power it conveys -- will surely continue so long as oil holds a central place,"" says Daniel Yergin in his new book, ""The Prize.""    And Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, Distinguished Professor of Economics Emeritus at Vanderbilt University, who was raised in Romania, writes: ""I happened to live through three wars, all in my backyard."" The basic cause of ""every one of those wars,"" he says, ""stemmed from the fact that at those times Romania had immense oil reserves which none of the belligerent powers wanted to letfall into the hands of its adversary.""    The aggressions of Iraq against Iran, then Kuwait and its threat to Saudi Arabia, and the blocking action of other nations are just the latest episodes in what Professor Georgescu-Roegen calls ""the indissoluble binding of grand politics with mineral resources.""    But another problem has emerged to complicate the politics and economics of oil -- the threat to the environment and human life. This week's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna focused, for the first time, on plans under way in Western Europe for curbing the use of oil to help reduce pollution by 1992. Calling the issue ""a serious challenge,"" a Saudi official said OPEC would direct its economists to study the environmental concerns of Western Europe and the effect they might have on the consumption of crude oil and refined products.   OPEC is naive to think the environmental ""challenge"" will come only from Western Europe. Eastern Europe, after decades of Communism, is even more polluted. Indeed, the threat of pollution from hydrocarbons is global, affecting rich and poor countries alike -- not excepting OPEC members.   Solutions to both poisonous mixtures -- oil andthe environment, and oil, money and power -- will depend on two key factors: new technology to reduce dependence on oil, and conservation. And there is no quick fix for either one.    Professor Georgescu-Roegen says that during the entire life of the human species, there have been only two viable technologies. The first he calls Prometheus I, based on the mastery of fire, the legendary gift of the Greek god Prometheus. Its fuel was wood.   But as consumption accelerated and the forests began to disappear in the latter part of the 17th century, there was a ""crisis of wood,"" in his words. This crisis was solved by two mortals, Thomas Savery and Thomas Newcomen, who invented the heat engine; this was Prometheus II, based chiefly on coal, then oil.   ""The problem now,"" says Professor Georgescu-Roegen, ""is whether and when a Prometheus III will come to get us out of the present muddle."" No one knows for sure. Meanwhile, the best strategy is to gain as much lead time as possible, and the way to do that is through conservation -- ""a conservation compatible with an acceptable survival of all humanity, without ignoring the needed development of those nations that are now in economic and social distress.""    Conservation, whether used to lessen dependency on oil from a highly troubled and explosive region or to combat the threat to the environment, cannot be the job of one nation or a few but must be the job of virtually all nations working together.    Yet a nation seeking to protect its own economy and security can still benefit greatly from conservation on its own. A dramatic example is Japan, completely dependent on imported oil, which after the oil shocks of the 1970's drastically cut its use of energy while maintaining the highest rate of economic growth in the world. Japan's per capita energy consumption is now just two-fifths that of the United States.    A combination of high energy taxes on consumers and strong financial incentives to industry to develop and use energy-efficient equipment made the difference.

Led by Saudi Arabia and Iran, several OPEC members increased production significantly in recent months to offset the daily loss of about four million barrels of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude embargoed during the Persian Gulf crisis, the Middle East Economic Survey said.   The survey, published weekly in Cyprus by independent economic researchers, said Iraq's production for the year was down 27 percent from 1989. It fell from 1.75 million barrels a day before the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 to 450,000 barrels a day afterward, used only for local consumption, the survey said.   Crude output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in December was estimated at 23.86 million barrels a day, up 230,000 barrels from November.","https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/15/business/opec-output-rose-in-90.html","","Oil production by OPEC kept rising in December, and the group's output for 1990 was the highest in 10 years, despite the global boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait, according to a survey released today.","D","14","1991-01-15T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/a561d50c-3430-5667-91af-4ddfe2b059af",162,"nyt://article/a561d50c-3430-5667-91af-4ddfe2b059af"
"  A free fall in the price of crude oil for February delivery, which plunged more than $10, to $21.44 a barrel yesterday, may have raised hopes for a rapid recovery in the nation's slumping economy. But even if a quick, successful end to the military campaign against Iraq pushes oil prices well below $15 a barrel by midsummer, as some oil analysts predict, daunting obstacles to economic growth will remain.    Although lower oil prices would help the economy, a number of underlying problems would remain. These include growing unemployment in military-supply and manufacturing industries, declining incomes, falling home prices, rising taxes and a credit crunch. Combined with the surge in oil prices after Iraq invaded Kuwait last August, these developments sharply depressed the confidence of consumers. Oil's Impact on the Recession     Many economists agree that if oil prices average $20 a barrel this year, instead of $30, economic output would rise by half a percentage point. That would lighten the blow of the recession, but not enough to alter significantly the forces that shaped the downturn.","https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/18/business/cheap-oil-may-not-be-enough-to-cure-recession.html","","A free fall in the price of crude oil for February delivery, which plunged more than $10, to $21.44 a barrel yesterday, may have raised hopes for a rapid recovery in the nation's slumping economy.

Indeed, expecting prices to rise, they were promising to freeze prices as a gesture of good will against charges of profiteering.   The price drops were due in part to the stunning success of the early bombing raids, which convinced traders that Saudi oil fields would be safe. But another key factor was shrewd planning by the Bush Administration. A week earlier, it and other Western nations announced that, at the outbreak of war, they would jointly release two million barrels of oil a day from government stockpiles. Mr. Bush backed that pledge to the hilt by announcing as soon as the shooting started that the United States would release more than a million barrels a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which contains 600 million barrels stored in underground salt caverns.","https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/21/opinion/mr-bush-pours-oil-on-troubled-traders.html","","Mideast war is supposed to send oil prices skyward and oil-importing economies downward.

"  Rising oil prices because of the Persian Gulf crisis helped propel the value of OPEC's petroleum exports last year to the highest level in nearly a decade, analysts estimated today.   The oil-producing nations last year earned $154.1 billion to $165.8 billion -- as much as 42 percent higher than their 1989 gains, estimates show.   Peter Bogin, the associate director for oil markets at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris, estimated that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries earned an extra $16 billion in the last half of the year because of the jump in crude prices and production because of the Persian Gulf conflict.   Of the bonanza, Saudi Arabia captured about $9.3 billion, Mr. Bogin's estimates show. The kingdom, the world's largest oil exporter, was pumping furiously to help compensate for any losses stemming from the conflict.   Iraq missed out on oil exports worth about $7.8 billion and Kuwait on $6.4 billion because their oil was embargoed during the surge, Mr. Bogin said.    Over all, he estimated the value of oil exports of the 13 OPEC nations at $154.1 billion last year.   Pierre Terzian, the editor of the Petrostrategies newsletter in Paris, calculated an estimate of $165.8 billion for last year, including crude, natural gas liquids and related products.   If prices had held at 1989 levels, he said, the oil producers would have exported $124.3 billion in oil and derivatives last year.   In 1989, OPEC reported the value of its members' oil exports at $116.6 billion. The group's 1990 tally will not be released until later this year.    Under Mr. Bogin's count, last year's earnings were the highest since 1983, when OPEC recorded exports worth $156.9 billion. With Mr. Terzian's scenario, they were the most since a 1982 tally of $202.8 billion.","https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/22/business/opec-oil-s-value-soars.html","","Rising oil prices because of the Persian Gulf crisis helped propel the value of OPEC's petroleum exports last year to the highest level in nearly a decade, analysts estimated today.","D","9","1991-01-22T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/b048216d-b86d-57ee-b9e0-650b6cf7fe4b",310,"nyt://article/b048216d-b86d-57ee-b9e0-650b6cf7fe4b"
"  Next to blood and water, gasoline is the most important liquid for Americans. So they wonder why the combination of plunging crude oil prices and ballooning petroleum industry profits isn't leading to a rollback of gasoline prices, which could help jump-start the stalled economy.   And that's why Congress should insist on restoring a windfall profits tax if the industry, which is announcing record profits this week, doesn't immediately start cutting prices. With Americans sacrificing in the Persian Gulf, the public won't tolerate Big Oil unpatriotically profiteering from the crisis.  That was quickly evident when consumers became outraged by the price spike that began after Aug. 2, when Iraq seized Kuwait. In New York City, the average pump price rose from $1.19 per gallon of regular gasoline in July to $1.54 in December (this week it is $1.39). The cost of filling up a 15-gallon tank rose from $17.85 to $23.10. Put another way, the extra outlay for gasoline and home heating oil for consumers, business and government in the five boroughs would be $1 billion over a year -- enough to fund the ""Safe Streets, Safe City"" police plan for three years.","https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/26/opinion/oil-prices-and-profits-what-goes-up.html","","Next to blood and water, gasoline is the most important liquid for Americans.

"  To the Editor:   ""Mr. Bush Pours Oil on Troubled Traders"" (editorial, Jan. 21) states that ""Hoarding, not an OPEC embargo, created most of the gas lines during the 1970's."" Neither hoarding nor the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries caused the gas lines; price controls did.   With a complete cutoff of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil since August, there have been no gas lines, just higher prices. Why? Because there are no price controls.    Throughout this century, international politics have induced many reductions in the supply of oil. Lines and shortages have developed only in times of price controls. This is not a coincidence.

"  COMPANIES British Airways Whines About Its New Competition  British Airways P.L.C. wants sympathy. Even after winning permission last week to fly between the United States and the Continent and penetrate the American market in a host of other ways -- rights no other foreign airline has had -- the British carrier is sounding defeated and distraught. It seems British Airways will have to accept some competition from United, American and Virgin Atlantic at Heathrow Airport, London's most convenient. The day before creditors were to seize Pan Am's planes, Pan Am and T.W.A. won British approval to sell their Heathrow routes to United and American. ""U.S. negotiators have succeeded in weakening British Airways,"" a spokesman for the airline intoned, as the company's chairman spoke of reduced profitability. Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, shed few tears. ""They're yelping so much it's suspicious,"" he said. British Airways already plans to invade the Continent by buying a large piece of Sabena World Airlines and forming a new carrier in Germany. The British deal hardly gives America's feeble old international carriers the strength to rise from their wheelchairs. Pan American World Airways, the sickliest case, is earning only enough from its route sale to perhaps survive until someone buys its remaining assets. And Trans World Airlines said the Transportation Department's ban on the sale of three of its six London routes to American, in the interests of competition, imperils its financial health. Maxwell's Plum, or Prune?  ""Maxwell's Plum,"" said a Daily News headline Wednesday morning. ""Miracle Max!"" and ""Daily News Lives!"" followed that afternoon. Now Robert Maxwell needs to live up to his headlines. The plum he agreed to buy after settling with the unions last Tuesday has shriveled to perhaps half its former circulation of a million-plus, and even less of its former advertising. His purchase of The News -- the Tribune Company is actually paying    him   $60 million or more to take on the newspaper's liabilities -- is based on agreements by the striking unions to accept sharp staffing cuts. Mr. Maxwell, a British publisher, promised to invest what the News called ""mega-money"" -- not to mention the mega-time he might need in his trans-Atlantic schedule to lure scores of advertisers, several hundred thousand readers and Jimmy Breslin back to his pages.  Exxon, and Taxpayers, Pay Up  For a company that earns as much as Exxon, $1.1 billion actually isn't real money. No sooner had the Exxon Corporation agreed to pay such a settlement to Alaska and the Federal Government in the Exxon Valdez oil spill than Lawrence G. Rawl, the company's chairman, said there would be virtually no effect on the company's earnings or image. The company also pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors. Exxon's ability to write off the whole settlement save a $100 million criminal penalty will cost taxpayers an estimated $300 million.  A Purge at Chrysler  Tough times provided the Chrysler Corporation with the perfect occasion to kick a union leader off its board. Cost-saving, Chrysler called it, adding that four of the other 18 members were leaving as well. In fact, it's the loss of labor's voice, responded Owen F. Bieber, president of the United Automobile Workers, a dissident on the board and the only departing member who is not in at least his late 60's. Labor representation, unusual on American boards, hardly seems to have hurt corporate competitiveness in countries like Germany. But by reversing itself on the issue, Chrysler has carried out Detroit's most celebrated boardroom purge since H. Ross Perot left General Motors. McDonald's New Burger  No, McDonald's will not draw in the bean sprouts and oat bran crowd with its new, reduced-fat burger. At best, analysts say, the health-conscious might stop sneering so loudly that they embarrass those for whom dieting means ordering the burger and fries without the shake. Diners who do try the ""McLean"" are likely to be disappointed, said Caroline Levy of Shearson Lehman. ""This doesn't even taste like a burger, based on what I've heard,"" she said. Like the company's recent abandonment of styrofoam containers to placate environmentalists, Ms. Levy said, ""It's good for McDonald's image, but I do not see it as good for the bottom line.""  In Brief  American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, reduced its lowest fares -- reviving the 30-day advanced-purchase ticket -- to encourage travelers frightened off by the Persian Gulf war or the recession. But some other fares are rising. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating the competitive practices of the Microsoft Corporation, the dominant maker of personal computer software. Microsoft calls the probe minor and limited, its competitors call it broad-ranging, and the F.T.C. is keeping quiet. The House reluctantly poured another $30 billion into the savings and loan bailout last week. THE ECONOMY   Putting a Leash on '900' Calls  The Federal Communications Commission proposes that callers to ""900"" numbers get to hear the price tags before they pay. Under rules announced Thursday, the ""900"" services would have to describe their prices and offerings, then give callers a chance to hang up before they are billed. No longer would callers applying for construction jobs learn only later that the calls had cost them $18 each, as the Government alleges, nor would callers for nearly useless credit cards end up paying $49.95. Several industry representatives blasted the F.C.C.'s proposal as a threat to legitimate ""900"" services; many provide weather, sports scores and stock information for willing customers.  The F.C.C. is likely to issue its final rules by the end of the year. Harsh Message in Output  Factory output fell in February for the fifth straight month, indicating that the recession continued to deepen. An eight-tenths of 1 percent drop last month brought production to the lowest level since June 1988. Lawrence Kudlow, the chief economist at Bear Stearns, said that considering last month's dismal employment report as well, the recession now looks to be as long as average. ""The short and mild argument has gone down with the February numbers,"" he said. But consumer confidence appeared to improve in early March after the war. Inflation Just Simmers Along Wholesale inflation continues to simmer despite a tepid economy. While producer prices overall fell six-tenths of 1 percent last month, the core rate, without volatile food and energy prices, rose four-tenths of 1 percent. Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover, said that like Goldilock's evaluation of the baby bear's porridge -- ""not too hot, not too cold,"" he sees the inflation report as ""not too inflationary, not too recessionary."" Some economists say inflation remains too strong for the Federal Reserve to further ease credit. Modest Cutback From OPEC  With Iraq no longer around to bluster about the need for much higher prices, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last week agreed to cut production by only 5 percent, or about a million barrels a day. The agreement demonstrates the influence of Saudi Arabia, which wants to keep prices moderate enough to guarantee long-term demand for its vast oil supplies. With neither Iraq nor Kuwait exporting, most OPEC members have quotas far higher than their previous levels. News of the OPEC agreement nudged oil prices up by only 69 cents last week to $20. The Great Bankruptcy Shield  France had the Theatre du Grand Guignol, presenting murder, rape, torture and suicide. The United States has the bankruptcy courts. The latest example of creative bankruptcy is an Equitable Life Assurance Society production, starring a partly empty 53-story Times Square office tower and grieving investors. The Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company accuses Equitable of deceiving other investors and trying to stick them with tens of millions of dollars in losses by throwing the partnership that owns the tower into bankruptcy. This, after Manville used the bankruptcy courts to confront its asbestos claimants; Texaco, to rebuff a challenge from Pennzoil, and Frank Lorenzo, to fend off his striking airline unions. Equitable and Manufacturers reached a tentative settlement on Friday, but negotiations on the exact terms continued. INTERNATIONAL   A Bigger Slice of Soviet Pie  Soviet officials harass foreign businesses, protesting crowds swarm around the Kremlin walls, but Pizza Hut's first two Moscow restaurants claim profit margins higher than in the United States. Russians line up down the block for the chance to pass an hour or two in a Western setting. But the trials of doing business in the Soviet Union have slowed Pizza Hut's expansion plans. Andrew Rafalat, the Pizza Hut executive who opened the restaurants in September, said he first needs to secure domestic supplies of meat and mozzarella cheese, to save the expense of buying them for hard currency in Western Europe and trucking them all the way in. Soviet meat suppliers are still incredulous when he asks them to meet his specifications. ""They say, 'We're giving you a scarce product. We're doing you a favor.' "" Mr. Rafalat, visiting the Pepsico parent company's New York headquarters last week, said he hopes to open some stand-alone take-out windows in Moscow by the end of the year. But as David Williams, senior vice president of Pepsico Food Service International, said, ""Nothing in the Soviet Union comes easily. Nothing is handed to you on a plate."" Except for some American-style pizzas, he hopes. Forgiving Poland  Leading industrialized nations have decided that the proto-capitalist Poles should not suffer for the borrowing binge of their deposed Communist rulers. To aid Poland's progress toward a market economy, officials meeting in Paris agreed to forgive about half the $33 billion owed and ease repayment terms on the rest. While micro-entrepreneurs have lined several of Warsaw's broadest boulevards with their booths, the most ambitious economic reforms in Eastern Europe have also caused severe unemployment. The Trade Police in Japan  Inspectors and police milling around an American rice exhibit at a Tokyo food show last week became, in the view of American officials, a prime exhibit of Japanese protectionism run amok. Japanese officials insisted that the sealed bags and plastic containers of American rice, if not the ""Have a Rice Day"" bumper stickers, violated laws against rice imports. Americans insisted the display was solely educational.","https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/17/business/business-diary-march-10-15.html","","COMPANIES British Airways Whines About Its New Competition British Airways P.L.C. wants sympathy.

Bieber, president of the United Automobile Workers, a dissident on the board and the only departing member who is not in at least his late 60's. Labor representation, unusual on American boards, hardly seems to have hurt corporate competitiveness in countries like Germany. But by reversing itself on the issue, Chrysler has carried out Detroit's most celebrated boardroom purge since H. Ross Perot left General Motors. McDonald's New Burger No, McDonald's will not draw in the bean sprouts and oat bran crowd with its new, reduced-fat burger. At best, analysts say, the health-conscious might stop sneering so loudly that they embarrass those for whom dieting means ordering the burger and fries without the shake. Diners who do try the ""McLean"" are likely to be disappointed, said Caroline Levy of Shearson Lehman. ""This doesn't even taste like a burger, based on what I've heard,"" she said. Like the company's recent abandonment of styrofoam containers to placate environmentalists, Ms. Levy said, ""It's good for McDonald's image, but I do not see it as good for the bottom line."" In Brief American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, reduced its lowest fares -- reviving the 30-day advanced-purchase ticket -- to encourage travelers frightened off by the Persian Gulf war or the recession. But some other fares are rising. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating the competitive practices of the Microsoft Corporation, the dominant maker of personal computer software. Microsoft calls the probe minor and limited, its competitors call it broad-ranging, and the F.T.C. is keeping quiet.

"  SAUDI ARABIA, the muscle behind the international oil cartel, made no secret of its aims at the meeting of OPEC ministers in Geneva last week: keeping the price of a barrel high enough to replenish its war-depleted treasury -- but not high enough to weaken the magic kingdom's grip on the market.   America, the muscle behind Saudi Arabia, is of two minds about the price of oil. On the one hand, policy makers worry that low prices would discommode their friends from Abu Dhabi to Houston.

DEFICIT. The war has increased the real budget deficit for this fiscal year by tens of billions of dollars, in all likelihood wiping out the $40 billion in savings for fiscal 1991 realized by the politically painful budget summit meeting of last summer. In addition, America's new, post-cold war military protectorate, along with the apparent success of our high-technology arsenal, has whetted the military appetite for new equipment suited to new missions in the third world. All of which has dashed hopes that a substantial peace dividend might finally reduce the deficit and free resources for domestic needs.","https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/24/business/quarter-notes-a-trimonthly-expression-of-opinion-postwar-economics.html","THE PERSIAN GULF WAR HAS TAKEN ITS economic toll, worsening the recession by increasing the budget deficit, temporarily spiking the price of oil and dampening consumer confidence.

"  To the Editor:   While it is perfectly reasonable for Americans to root for a low oil price, as you say in ""Why Pay Ransom to OPEC?"" (editorial, March 15), we must keep in mind that the Middle East petroleum belongs to the nations under whose land that oil lies. The tendency to refer to that oil as ""our oil"" is understandable, but it is a delusion. Unless the intention is to seize that asset and make it ""our oil.""   Precisely that notion is apparent in your tone. Deciding the proper price for someone else's property smacks of would-be piracy. And your wish list for a low price does not carry with it a benefit for ordinary consumers. For them, you have in mind a gas tax estimate of 20 cents to $2 a gallon!","https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/08/opinion/l-somebody-has-to-pay-for-our-cheap-oil-161691.html","","To the Editor:","A","14","1991-04-08T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/d4170b41-d036-53f3-84a5-e0b8b3670ffb",250,"nyt://article/d4170b41-d036-53f3-84a5-e0b8b3670ffb"

"  To the Editor:   To the Editor:   William Safire (column, April 9) supposes that black gold -- oil -- is ""how to save Russia."" Kazakhstan alone could contain as much oil as Saudi Arabia was presumed to have in 1980 (before effectively doubling its reserves). Republics from Communist rubble represent the most significant threat to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   The oil infrastructure of the former Soviet republics is in ruins: to replace it (not just repair it) will require investments of $200 billion -- before sufficient oil can reach markets to earn the hard currency required to save Russia, Kazakhstan and the other republics. Then, after the $200 billion has been spent by the republics, $300 billion more or so will be required to develop extensive reserves of oil and gas: the Tenghiz field in Kazakhstan alone will cost $100 billion.

"THE misery index -- developed by the late Arthur Okun, an economist -- adds together the unemployment rate and the inflation rate and is meant to summarize the economy's overall performance.

In the debates and elsewhere, President Bush repeatedly said that the misery index was down considerably from the Carter years. The country didn't buy it. 

Mr. Bush's use of the misery index reflected the almost exclusive focus of economic policy in the 1980's on growth and price stability. There is no doubt that the rate of economic growth and the rate of inflation are two important criteria for judging the success of any economic policy. But a full evaluation of economic performance must also include measures of distributive justice. That is, how equitably the nation's overall gains are allocated. If a strong overall economy does not improve economic conditions for most people, especially the poor, or if economic gains are not fairly distributed, then any claims of overall prosperity ring hollow.","https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/20/business/viewpoints-the-misery-index-only-half-the-story.html","THE misery index -- developed by the late Arthur Okun, an economist -- adds together the unemployment rate and the inflation rate and is meant to summarize the economy's overall performance.

"Even with the battering it's taken in recent years, General Motors remains larger than life. And last week, true to form, it dominated the news -- a public-relations bull's-eye one day, a mind-boggling loss the next. First, refusing to just lick its wounds after a jury held it responsible for a teen-ager's death in a G.M. pickup, the company roared onto the offensive, suing NBC for tampering with a truck in a news report. It scored a direct hit, as NBC -- to settle the suit -- issued a stunningly long (three-and-a-half-minute) on-air apology. Then, with no qualms about kicking the downed network, the auto maker suspended advertising on all NBC News programs. (After just a day, however, saying it was satisfied with the apology, it rescinded that ban.) And to thicken the plot, a judge dealt G.M. a setback in its grand plan to close numerous plants -- and gave at least a temporary reprieve to 2,500 auto workers whose jobs are threatened. Saying that by accepting tax abatements G.M. had effectively promised to keep its Willow Run plant, in Ypsilanti, Mich., open through the 1990's, the judge blocked it from closing the plant. G.M. had planned to close it this summer and consolidate operations in Arlington, Tex. Calling the ruling ""unprecedented and contrary to both the facts and the law,"" G.M. said it would appeal. The company had tried to forfeit the tax breaks, but Doug Winters, the Ypsilanti city attorney, said, ""We want the jobs, not the money. G.M. is not above the law.""  Sprinting for the Red  Has Carl Lewis gone into accounting? He must have, the way records are getting broken. But corporate America surely hopes these records will last. First, Ford reported a $7.4 billion loss for 1992, mainly because of its retiree accounting, erasing I.B.M.'s recent record for the nation's largest loss. But its title lasted just a day, as General Motors came in with a stunning $23.5 billion figure. Without the special charges, though, there were signs of improving operations. G.M. stock did well, ending the week at $40.625, while Ford shares slipped to $49.25. A Poorer Sears, a New Sears  Another fixture of the corporate landscape dumped some hefty numbers onto its balance sheet last week. In reporting a $3.9 billion deficit, Sears, Roebuck cited hurricane-related losses at its Allstate Insurance unit and the costs of scrapping its catalogue. Not to mention its charge for retiree benefits -- $1.87 billion. Later in the week, after pausing to let the news sink in, the retailer looked squarely at the future, vowing to spend $4 billion to give its stores face lifts.  More Shrinkage at I.B.M.  It may have to rename itself I.B. if it gets any smaller. I.B.M. only recently said it would cut its work force by 25,000, but word spread last week that it could be more like 40,000. The numbers tell the tale of the incredible shrinking company. Workers: 407,000 in 1986, 300,000 at the end of '92 . . . and 260,000 at the end of '93? Stock price: over $100 last summer, $50.75 on Friday. Short Chapter at Random House  Joni Evans has had a bumpy ride at Random House. In 1987 she was recruited to start her own imprint. Then she was named to head the adult trade division. That lasted just a few years, and she then created Turtle Bay Books. But now Turtle Bay is no more. Ms. Evans said she always thought ""it would be three to four years before we broke even, and I thought he did, too."" But ""he"" -- Alberto Vitale, Random House chairman -- said, ""Conditions have changed."" Survival of the Techiest  It makes the head spin. You're slogging through the evening's cable offerings -- the 12 talk shows, the 15 football games -- when some long-distance company calls to explain its convoluted advantages. Now it's all getting mixed up together; the cable and phone businesses are cross-breeding, embarking on an odd Darwinian struggle. Last week, in the first deal of its kind, Southwestern Bell agreed to buy two cable systems from Hauser Communications -- the onset of a race to deliver all manner of communications services, like more cable offerings than you'll ever keep track of. Soon, perhaps, you'll reach for the phone to turn on a movie, or turn on the set to call Aunt Nellie -- or finally, in low-tech despair, sit down and read a book. Hello, Phone -- Get Me Rewrite  Meanwhile, phone technology moves relentlessly on. In Nynex's latest bid to improve the human lot, you can say ""Mom"" and the phone calls your mom. And only yours, mind you. Other voices get other moms. In the system Nynex will soon begin testing, each household member compiles a separate voice directory of dozens of names. Is the system perfect? Well, no. Nynex officials concede that if Dana Carvey barked out ""Barbara,"" the former First Lady's phone could easily ring. HB>THE ECONOMY   Clinton Works the Crowd  President Clinton laid it out succinctly. ""With all these economic improvements, we aren't generating new jobs,"" he said at his ""town meeting."" And the deficit, he said, ""is about $50 billion a year bigger than I was told."" Questioners veered to other topics, but Mr. Clinton kept steering back to the economy. On Wednesday he will propose higher taxes and painful budget cuts, and he wanted to soften up his audience -- to assure them his plan would be ""fair to all Americans."" He did offer one specific: he will seek to raise the corporate tax rate -- a message he then gave to 200 executives and lobbyists at the White House. Read Their Lips: 'Don't Touch'  In casting about for a billion here, a billion there, to hack from the deficit, Mr. Clinton will have to look hard at many sacred items. But some things are more sacred than others -- like Social Security cost-of-living increases. His budget director, Leon Panetta, had proposed a one-year freeze, but Mr. Clinton -- possibly with visions of irate retirees at the White House barricades -- put his machete away. A freeze, falling hardest on the poor, is a far cry from soaking the rich. But he has not ruled out increasing taxes on benefits, since that would not affect low-income people.  Inflation Stays in Check   Inflation is well under control even as economic growth gains momentum. Prices at the wholesale level rose a modest 0.2 percent in January. Over the past year the Producer Price Index has risen just 1.8 percent -- a minor gain for an expanding economy. Detroit vs. Japan: No Contest  Detroit was armed for battle. Thinking the time was right and the new Administration sympathetic, it had spent serious money preparing to file complaints seeking steep duties on imported cars. But once its plans leaked out, the rock-throwing started. Cries of protectionism filled the air, foreign auto makers and governments trained their heavy lobbying guns on Detroit, and even Mickey Kantor, the top American trade official, voiced qualms. The final blow came when General Motors, bombarded by Japanese pressure, defected. The auto makers, while insisting they had a strong case, saw that without a united front they had no chance and backed off. The move was a reprieve for the Administration, which would have been forced to resolve this sticky issue quickly.  INTERNATIONAL   Speed. Freedom. . . . Tolls?   Autobahn. The very word spits out images of untamed horsepower, foot to the Porsche floor, the ultimate open road -- in short, freedom. With no tolls, and long stretches with no speed limits, the network of superhighways has deep resonance for Germany, and the world. But again, yesterday's sacred cow becomes today's hamburger. The realities: severe congestion and a German economy whose horsepower is dwindling. So Bonn plans the unthinkable: charging user fees on the Autobahn and eventually privatizing it. Well, there are still video games. Bonjour, Vietnam  On the first visit by a Western leader since 1975, Francois Mitterrand promised to double aid to Vietnam -- if human rights improve -- and urged Washington to end its economic embargo. Local radio said the visit showed that the West saw Vietnam's ""will to join the mainstream economy."" Tax the Other Guy, Not Saudi Oil  Saudi Arabia is worried. There's a lot of talk about taxes to cut oil use. And now that Saudi Arabia has replaced Russia as the largest oil producer, the Saudis have the most to lose. This threat also comes just as Saudi Arabia is trying to pare OPEC output to push prices higher. So the Saudi oil minister, Hisham M. Nazer, in Houston last week, pulled out all the stops. Citing ""constant discrimination against oil,"" he called environmentalists' policies ""alarming."" Oil import fees ""defy the logic of geology and economics."" And, citing the crying need for global economic growth, he said, ""Abject poverty is indeed the worst environmental pollutant.""","https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/14/business/business-diary-february-7-12.html","","Even with the battering it's taken in recent years, General Motors remains larger than life.

"  THE ECONOMY If the Numbers Don't Lie, America's Going Back to Work  Is it as good news as it seems that the nation's unemployment rate plunged from 6.8 percent to 6.4 percent in November? Skeptics were quick to say that for complicated statistical reasons, the progress reported by the Labor Department last week was almost surely overstated, and financial markets shrugged it off. But with any kind of faith, what you see is a stunning number -- the biggest improvement in a decade, and a compelling sign that this on-again, off-again economy is at last performing its most basic function: creating jobs. Employers added jobs from California to Florida to New York, and most places in between -- and they were more likely to be full-time jobs, too. As those of you with jobs well know, companies have been putting off hiring and leaning on existing workers, uncertain about things like medical costs, but this news may show that they just couldn't hold out any longer. An Economy on a Spree It's more than jobs. The economic engine keeps gaining speed as it barrels toward that year-end blowout -- which long ago, rumor has it, was some sort of religious celebration. But once Christmas is past, will the vigor survive? Economists are cautious. Last week, though, the numbers were strong: income, construction spending, and factory orders all up, the purchasing managers' index showing the fastest growth since last winter. There were some blips: new-home sales were off, but that followed a surge the month before, so housing still looks good. And retail sales rose just slightly -- but of course any shoppers worth their credit cards would not dream of going wild till it's almost Christmas. Tired of Waiting for S.& L. Job  It's clearly liberating to be nominated for a Government job and then decide it isn't worth jumping through all the hoops. Stanley Tate, named in July to head the Resolution Trust Corporation, but still awaiting a confirmation hearing, didn't mince words last week when he called it quits. ""Washington,"" he said, ""is a vicious city, with all kinds of hidden agendas. It is a city full of rumors, allegations and accusations."" And why did his nomination die? Because he's a Republican? Because Bill Clinton didn't back him fully? Or because there was something to the ""serious questions"" that Donald Riegle, Senate Banking chairman, had about Mr. Tate? Mr. Tate's version: bureaucrats were afraid he'd root out mismanagement. Whatever the reason, Mr. Tate, a Florida developer, said he felt ""disposable and dispensable."" And the bailout agency just keeps on drifting. Mending Hubble, Mending NASA  If NASA were a corporation, it would long since have become an obscure Wal-Mart subsidiary. It's made one cosmic gaffe after another: the Challenger disaster, the flawed Hubble Space Telescope, the apparent kidnapping of the Mars Observer by little green spacepersons. It's no understatement to say, as one space expert did last week, ""NASA can't afford another highly visible failure."" So the pressure's on the astronauts on the shuttle Endeavour, which lifted off on Thursday. The astronauts' mission: to fix Hubble in mid-space, essentially by putting a pair of eyeglasses on it. If they succeed, secrets of the universe could snap into focus; if they fail, the focus will be on NASA's jugular. But as one Hubble scientist put it, ""This is not like going to Grandma's to fix a leaky faucet.""  OPEC, Where Is Thy Sting?  Twenty years ago, OPEC seemed sure to strangle America with ever-higher oil prices. But last week it was clear just how times had changed. After slipping all year, oil prices plunged to a five-year low after OPEC failed to agree to cut output. So gasoline, steadily cheaper in 1973 dollars, seems likely to get cheaper still, which would help the economy. But everything has a cost, and cheaper gas means auto makers are less likely to put their efforts into making more efficient cars. Victor Posner Is Out of Play  It was an unusual penalty, but the judge said the scope of the violations justified it. Saying they ""have had a long and notorious history of engaging in self-dealing and corporate waste,"" a Federal judge last week banned Victor Posner and his son, Steven, from serving as officers or directors of any public company. The order came in a civil suit brought by the S.E.C. as part of a broader case against Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky, and it involved charges that the Posners made secret stock deals with Mr. Boesky. In light of past abuses, the judge said, another warning ""would serve little purpose.""  COMPANIES Paying a Price for Family Values  Family values. So simple a term, yet so laden with subtext. On the surface, it means apple pie, caring, a cozy hearth; but it can also be a code phrase for excluding, condemning, even denying the existence of anything but cookie-cutter Americans. Normally, to cry ""family values"" is just free speech, but in Texas last week, the price was high. Apple Computer planned to build an $80 million office complex north of Austin, creating 1,500 jobs. But county officials rejected a $750,000 tax abatement, citing Apple's policy of granting health benefits to employees' unmarried partners, and Apple took its blueprints and hit the road.  Sony's Pain, And the World's In 1946, in a bombed-out Tokyo department store, a young man named Akio Morita helped found the Sony Corporation. Since then, as both Sony and Japan grew mighty, Mr. Morita became, in one American's words, the world's ""leading Japanese business statesman."" So it is symbolic that as Japan's phenomenal half-century shows distinct wear and tear, Sony's chairman falters. Last week Mr. Morita, 72, underwent brain surgery, and he may have to retire. That would be bad news for Sony, where, even removed from day-to-day operations, he remained the ""psychological backbone."" And it would be bad news abroad, for Mr. Morita has played a leading role in smoothing trade tensions with America. Volvo Vants to Be Alone  The planned Volvo-Renault merger created serious friction at Volvo. Many executives wanted to back out, loath to let Sweden lose one of its corporate stars. But the chairman, Pehr Gyllenhammar, stuck to the plan, seeing strength in having a European partner. Last week Mr. Gyllenhammar lost his fight: The merger was called off, and he quickly resigned, saying that Volvo's managers had ""turned their backs on Europe."" Job Cuts: A Weekly Ritual  It almost stops being news, squarely in a class with ""Dog Bites Man."" Another week, and more corporate giants cut thousands of jobs. Last week was no exception. A. T.& T. may cut as many as 4,500 jobs as the long-distance wars take their toll. And airline woes continue to seep through to Boeing, which will cut production, meaning a loss of up to 3,000 jobs. Even the beer industry is pulling in its belly, as Miller said it would close a plant in upstate New York, eliminating 900 jobs.  G.M. Downsizes Its Data  Saturated with economic numbers?

The pact now goes into effect on Jan. 1, and the vigil will begin to see which side was right about jobs.   Tokyo Sweet-Talks the Market    All the Japanese stock market was waiting for, it seems, were some rosy words from the Government; last week it got them. Stock prices had been sliding for weeks. But after the Government finally promised to do what it could, the Nikkei index surged more than 4 percent in a day, then 2 percent the next. Prices are still depressed, though, and they are likely to stay that way until Government actions follow words.

Later, though obsessed with nuclear weapons, the world still cared about Russian oil: In the 1960's, Soviet dumping of cheap oil was the goad that led to the formation of a different cartel, OPEC.   Today, the Russian oil and gas industry, already producing 80 percent of Russia's hard-currency export earnings, is the cash cow that could help yank a crippled, chaotic economy back to its feet, and energy is arguably the single most important factor holding together the post-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States.

The Republicans immediately vowed to pass their cuts anyway, and accused Mr. Clinton of shirking the duties of fiscal leadership.

The absence of such a recommendation from the Group of Seven economic summit  is all the more striking because the very reason the G-7 was founded was to deal with the economic fallout and currency disruptions set off by the 1973 oil shock.

" INTERNATIONAL 3-19     Asian Economic Stresses May Cause Political Waves   As its juggernaut stumbles, Asian frustrations could cause upheavals in politics and social life. The threat is causing apprehension in many countries. 1     Czech Premier Steps Down   Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus announced his Government's resignation, after a call to do so by President Vaclav Havel. Mr. Klaus, a noted reform economist, lost standing with a financial scandal in his party. 19     OPEC Plans More Output   OPEC raised its oil production ceiling by 10 percent, despite fears within the group that the increase might hurt prices. But the increase is not as big as it appears, because the previous ceiling was widely violated. 5     Indian Parties Try to Regroup   India's main political parties maneuvered feverishly to cobble together a coalition to replace the 14-party Government that collapsed on Friday. 9     Political Surprise in Taiwan   Taiwan's governing party suffered surprising losses in local elections. 12     The Divide in Kyoto   A divisive issue at the global warming talks opening Monday will be burden-sharing between rich and poor. But there is some hope that the issue might be resolved. 6     Challenge to Congo's Leader   Six months in power, Laurent Kabila's Government faced its first direct challenge, in shootouts that killed as many as 18 people. 15     Germany's Melting Pot   Almost 9 percent of Germany's population are foreigners, but Germany resists talk of a melting pot. 3     NATIONAL 20-43     Plans to Test Medicines In Children Draws Dissent  Opposition has erupted over a proposal by President Clinton that would require drug companies to test their products in children before putting new medicines on the market. Mr. Clinton says such studies will improve health care for children, but drug companies say the proposal would needlessly put thousands of children at risk. 1    Who Gets Water in the West   From the Colorado River to California's Central Valley, water from the subsidized farms and playgrounds created by Government irrigation is being diverted to nearly extinct wildlife, long-forgotten Indian tribes and cities that barely existed when the big dams and canals were built. 1    Trucks Favored by the Law   If most sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans were classified as cars, they would violate Federal standards for pollution and gasoline consumption aimed at protecting the environment and conserving energy. Instead, lawmakers have granted special favors to makers and buyers of light trucks. 1    A Cookie Jar on Wheels   There has never been a human fatality or serious mauling by a black bear in Yosemite National Park. There have been, however, 600 car break-ins this year, causing over $500,000 in damage, from bears drawn by careless campers who leave food on seats and in trunks. 20    Gay Foster Parent Debate   A Texas child welfare supervisor's decision to remove a baby boy from the care of a foster parent who is a lesbian has focused attention on a 118-year-old state statute that makes homosexual activity a crime. 20    NEW YORK/REGION 45-50    Investment Fraud Spreads   Investment fraud is spreading across the country, with New York at its center, according to law enforcement officials and securities regulators. The fraud involves the sale of marginal companies' low-priced stocks to amateur investors who are besieged by telephone sales calls. While the victims are usually told that the company in question is the next Microsoft or McDonald's, the shares they buy often turn out to be worthless. 1     Perilous Cyclists   The sight of restaurant deliverymen on beat-up bicycles riding on sidewalks or going the wrong way on one-way streets is increasingly common. And the frequent near misses and occasional, harrowing accidents, like the death of a 68-year-old pedestrian who was struck on an Upper West Side sidewalk by a deliveryman, illuminate the conflicting demands of speed and safety. 45    Brooklyn's Woodlands   Brooklyn's last forest, which is in Prospect Park, is being restored to the ''rich, dark, cool'' woodland envisioned by the park's designers, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. The project includes rustic bridges, three waterfalls and thousands of new plants, trees and shrubs. 47     OBITUARIES 52-53    Richard R.

" Seoul Crisis Worsens As More Banks Close  South Korea closed five more banks, accelerated its promised foreign access to domestic stock and bond markets and pledged to infuse money into beleaguered securities companies, but the moves did little to arrest the country's financial crisis.     In a strong sign that investors are losing confidence that the $57 billion I.M.F. rescue package for South Korea will work, the Korean won fell its daily allowable limit for the fourth straight day, raising the possibility that more rescue money may be required. The won is now worth about half what it was against the dollar at the beginning of 1997. And the Korean stock market resumed falling this morning after a gain yesterday. [Page D4.]    South Koreans now regard Dec. 3, the day the I.M.F. accord was reached, as ''National Humiliation Day,'' a telling barometer of the resentment the rescue effort has caused. [A1.]    Asia Problems Hit Stocks Again  Wall Street was rattled for the third consecutive day on fresh reminders that the economic turmoil in Asia could erode corporate profits in this country. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 70.87 points, to 7,978.79, but the biggest losses were in technology stocks, which are viewed as more vulnerable to Asia's weakness. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 23.94, to 1,596.61, and the Pacific Stock Exchange Technology Index dropped 6.70, to 295.52. [D16.]    Bond prices advanced for the second straight day on a migration to the safe-haven of Treasuries by investors concerned over Asia's crisis. The gains pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.07 percent from 6.11 percent Tuesday. [D23.]     A $975 million purchase of Corning's housewares business by AEA Investors was scrapped over the buyer's concern about slow sales due to Asia's turmoil. [D4.]    Boston Edison Sells 12 Plants  Boston Edison sold 12 of its 13 power plants to a French-controlled company, Sithe Energies, for $657 million. Boston Edison plans to cut rates by 15 percent for its 650,000 customers, starting in March, when Massachusetts is to open utilities to competition. [D2.]    A Setback to BellSouth Hopes  The Justice Department recommended that the F.C.C. not allow BellSouth to offer long-distance service in Louisiana, another obstacle in the aspirations of the regional Bell telephone companies. [D2.]    Current Account Deficit Widens  The nation's deficit on the current account, the broadest measure of foreign trade, widened 11.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted $42.156 billion in the third quarter. Asia's economic crisis weakened American exports. [D2.]    Japan's current account deficit tripled in October due partly to the yen's decline against the dollar in currency markets. [D15.]    The dollar fell on warnings from Japanese officials they would sell dollars to defend the yen. In New York yesterday the dollar cost 129.28 yen, down from 129.59 Tuesday. [D14.]    Energy Futures Prices Tumble  Crude oil and gasoline futures prices fell almost 3 percent on signs that exports from Iraq could resume by January, just as OPEC increases production. [D14.]    No Moose on Mercedes' Bonnet  In a one-day advertising blitz, Mercedes-Benz proudly announced it had fixed the car maker's new A-Class subcompact so that it now passed the ''moose test.'' The company sought to restore confidence in the bubble-shaped four-seater after test drivers for a Swedish car magazine flipped it over during a high-speed evasion maneuver known as the ''moose test.'' [D11.]    A New Front in Burger War  Burger King keeps trying to chip away at McDonald's fast-food dominance. A few months ago, it was the Big King challenge to the Big Mac. Now Burger King is planning a huge promotion focused on its new french fries. A $70 million advertising campaign will feature Mr. Potato Head as spokesspud. For those unswayed by Mr. Potato Head's charms, Burger King will give away fries.

" INTERNATIONAL   A3-9    NATO and Moscow Agree On Russian Role in Kosovo  NATO and Russian military commanders resolved their differences over Russia's role in the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo, clearing the way for about 3,600 more Russian troops to enter the province. Officials said the first planeloads could begin arriving today. The Russians agreed -- with great reluctance, officials said -- to serve under the nominal control of the allied commanders of each sector where they will operate, but they reserved the right to refuse to carry out orders.   A1    The Kosovo village Bela Crkva buried its dead in a bitter, tearful ceremony. Most of the 64 people laid to final rest had initially been buried furtively, at night, by other villagers near where the victims were shot to death, reportedly by Serbian forces hours after the NATO bombing began. The reburial came after war crimes investigators completed their work in the town.   A1    Trouble for Pakistani Leader  Opposition political parties at home criticized Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for promising in Washington to withdraw Pakistani-backed forces from the Indian side of the cease-fire line in the disputed territory of Kashmir. Mr. Sharif's pledge seemed to be viewed by most Pakistanis as a sell-out of the Kashmir cause or an ill-fated move in a diplomatic game of chess.   A3    Barak Cabinet Is Complete  The Prime Minister-elect of Israel, Ehud Barak, named a Finance Minister, a Justice Minister and others to complete his ministerial appointments. Mr. Barak and his Cabinet are expected to be be sworn in today.   A7    Agency Head Assails Policy  J. Brian Atwood, the departing director of the Agency for International Development, the Government's major foreign aid agency, criticized the Administration for allowing itself to be ''pushed around'' by Congress and warned that legislative cuts in foreign aid had created a crisis.   A4    Mexico Results and Predictions  The candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has won every presidential election since the 1920's, won election as governor of the state of Mexico, the country's most populous. His victory challenged thinking that the party, known as the PRI, was flagging and would be unable to mount a viable campaign for the presidency next year. But a PRI loss in another governor's race also showed opposition parties the power that can come from their joining forces.   A8    Somalia Cracks Down on Crime  Four self-appointed Islamic courts in Mogadishu began a huge counterbanditry operation as part of efforts to restore order in the capital, officials said. The courts have already closed dozens of illegal checkpoints, where the city's various rival militia groups terrorize local residents and extort money.   (Reuters)    World Briefing   A9    NATIONAL   A10-14    Gunman Had a History Of Hate-Filled Acts  Benjamin Smith, who the F.B.I. said killed himself late Sunday rather than be captured after a deadly rampage directed at members of minorities in Illinois and Indiana, had become increasingly bold in expressing his racist views, people who had encountered him said. Last year, while a college student, he outraged neighborhoods in Bloomington, Ind., by tossing plastic bags containing white supremacist pamphlets into thousands of yards.   A1    New Political Players  Private investigators are playing a larger role in the public arena, digging up dirt on people like regulators, elected national and small-town officials. Their reports are usually aimed at discrediting or disposing of their clients' critics or opponents, but they are also used defensively, to find and avoid potential embarrassments. And their ranks are increasingly being joined by ex-journalists, who can tap old news contacts to get negative information published.   A1    Gore, Bush and Female Voters  Al Gore is trailing George W. Bush among women, despite a determined effort by Mr. Gore and his campaign to appeal to female voters. Advisers suggest that Mr. Gore may be a casualty of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, though the Vice President himself rejected that notion in an interview.   A13    Democrats are talking up the idea of Mr. Gore naming a woman as running mate. But who?   A13    Plan to Lift Appalachia  President Clinton, visiting eastern Kentucky, presented a package of proposals intended to increase investment in the idle coal fields, which have largely been bypassed by the prosperity of the 1990's. The plan would use Federal tax credits and loan guarantees to induce private companies and investors to build plants and stores.   A10    Election of Church Leader  The United Church of Christ, a 1.4 million-member denomination that traces some of its roots back to the Puritans, elected as its president the Rev. John H. Thomas, 48, who is widely known for his work in ecumenical relations. He succeeds the Rev. Paul Sherry.   A11    Plea in Maryland Slaying  A Maryland teen-ager pleaded not guilty in an Israeli court to murder charges arising from a 1997 killing in Maryland. The teen-ager, Samuel Sheinbein, 19, did admit to dismembering the victim's body and burying it. But his lawyer challenged the prosecution to prove that Mr. Sheinbein had actively participated in the killing with a friend, who committed suicide in a Maryland prison before his trial was to begin. Mr. Sheinbein, whose father was born in Israel, fled to Israel, whose Supreme Court ruled that he is an Israeli citizen and therefore could not be extradited.   A13    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-7    Record Heat in Region Will Linger a Bit Longer  The temperature hit 101 degrees in Central Park, a record for a July 5, according to the National Weather Service on Long Island. In Washington, it was 102 degrees, 100 in Philadelphia and Newark, 99 in Atlantic City and 94 as far north as Portland, Me. The heat index, which considers temperature and humidity, registered 110 degrees or more across the region for most of the day. Forecasters said the high temperatures could last through tomorrow, before a cold front settled in.   A1    Third Party Candidate?  Lowell P. Weicker Jr., 68, left, the former Governor and Senator from Connecticut, is being courted by strategists for Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota to seek the Reform Party nomination for President. And Mr. Weicker is interested. Ross Perot has not announced his intentions.   B1    Fireworks Injuries  City police and fire officials said the holiday was marred by several injuries caused by illegal fireworks.   B3    Doctors Cite Company Abuses  Three years after New York State enacted the Managed Care Bill of Rights to combat abuses by managed care companies, a survey of city doctors suggests that many of those abuses not only continue but in many cases have grown worse.   B5    SCIENCE TIMES   F1-8    New View of the Dolphin  Scientists are discovering that dolphins are far from happy, peaceful creatures. Unlike most animal killers, which eat their prey, dolphins seem to have murderous urges unrelated to the need for food.   F1    Witches, Aliens, Sleep Disorder  A growing number of scholars believe sleep paralysis -- a brief but intense condition in which the brain seems awake but the body cannot move -- may help explain ancient reports of attacks by witches and modern claims of alien abduction.   F1    A Case for Rogue Planets  Several Earth-like planets, created billions of years ago during the formation of our solar system, may be wandering in deep space harboring conditions that could sustain some form of life, a prominent planetary scientist theorized.

C1    Phone Merger Talks  Qwest executives gathered in Denver and Manhattan to begin preliminary and separate merger discussions with executives from both Frontier, the long-distance telephone company, and U S West, the regional Bell company.   C1    Sign of Optimism in Japan  The Bank of Japan's quarterly assessment of business sentiment showed that the perception of business conditions among more than 9,000 executives who responded in June was still negative, but improving -- within the range of estimates by economists. The Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks rose 1.13 percent yesterday, but slipped in morning trading today, down 11.21 points at noon, or 0.1 percent, to 18,123.85.

The directive reflects the rapidly intensifying competition in Europe to offer high-speed Internet access and other broadband services. But it also highlights the difficult situation facing the former state monopoly: competition is likely to accelerate the growth of the high-speed market, but it could also reduce British Telecommunications' slice of it.

" Microsoft Hires Lobbyist To Curry Favor With Bush  Microsoft has hired Ralph Reed, a senior consultant to Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign and a former head of the Christian Coalition, to lobby Mr. Bush in opposition to the government's antitrust case against the software giant.   Microsoft's aim, the company says, is to curry favor with the apparent Republican presidential nominee, hoping he will speak out against the government's case -- and, perhaps, take a softer approach toward the company if he is elected president.

" Offer for Fashionmall.com Draws Regulators' Scrutiny  Fashionmall.com, a little-known Silicon Alley online retailer, seems to have become the target of a takeover attempt that has attracted the attention of securities regulators.    A company called Narax offered to buy Fashionmall for $3.50 a share, or $26.2 million. At the time, Fashionmall's stock was trading at $2.10. The chief executive of Fashionmall could not contact Narax and dismissed the offer. But Nasdaq halted trading of Fashionmall's stock on Thursday after it rose 22 percent, minutes after Narax issued a release that detailed its bid. The run-up in the stock has prompted interest from regulators and Nasdaq officials, people close to the matter said. Fashionmall executives said they were concerned about stock manipulation.

A8    Russian Airliner Hijacked  At least two men identifying themselves as Chechens and claiming to have a bomb hijacked a Russian plane carrying 174 people after it left Istanbul. They forced it to land in Saudi Arabia, where some passengers were freed or escaped.   A8    Troops in Congo Start Pullback  The Congolese government and one of its chief military supporters, Zimbabwe, as well as officials from Rwanda and Uganda -- which support rebel forces -- all said they were observing a deadline to begin moving troops back almost 10 miles from the meandering front line that has divided Congo into several parts.   A7    Push to Re-elect Annan to U.N.  The Organization of African Unity opened a campaign to have Secretary General Kofi Annan, a Ghanian, elected to another five-year term.   A8    World Briefing   A6    NATIONAL   A10-16    Senate Votes to Toughen Federal Bankruptcy Laws  The Senate, voting 83 to 15, approved a bill to overhaul federal bankruptcy laws and make it harder for people to erase their debts. The House has passed a similar bill, and President Bush has signaled he will sign whatever compromise is reached.   A1    Most provisions concern individuals, but changes in rules affecting companies may affect far more people.   C1    Soft-Money Ban Losing Appeal  Senate Democrats are growing wary about overhauling the campaign finance system because they raised more unlimited, unregulated donations than the Republicans did during the 2000 election cycle.   A1    President Bush issued a broad set of principles that he said would serve as his framework for assessing campaign finance legislation, including a partial ban on soft-money donations to political parties.   A14    Not All Heads Count the Same  The Census Bureau said it missed at least 6.4 million people in the 2000 count and counted at least 3.1 million people twice. That is an improvement over the 1990 census, which overlooked 8.4 million Americans and double-counted 4.4 million others, for a net undercount of 4 million.   A12    Civilians No Factor, Sailors Say  Three civilians who were at some of the controls of the submarine Greeneville when it struck and sank a Japanese trawler played no role in the accident, crew members of the submarine testified at a court of inquiry.   A12    Atheist Leader Declared Dead  A forensics expert hired by the government confirmed that bones dug up at a remote Texas ranch were those of Madalyn Murray O'Hair and two relatives, who were last seen alive in 1995. Officials believe kidnappers killed the three in an extortion plot.   A10    Charges for 5 Miami Officers  Five members of the Miami Police Department's SWAT team were charged with lying during a federal investigation of a 1996 drug raid in which a 73-year-old man was killed in a hail of 123 bullets.   A12    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-10    City's 6% Growth Outpaced The Rest of the State  The population of New York City grew by 456,000 during the last decade, surging past 8 million for the first time and outpacing growth in its own suburbs and the state at large, census data showed. The rise was fueled by a decade of sustained immigration that was combined with several years of  prosperity.   A1    Most of the city's growth took place in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. Latinos now outnumber blacks in the city, and nearly one in 10 New Yorkers is Asian. Whites are just over one-third of the population.   A1    The census figures, which show a population shift toward New York City and away from upstate areas, bode well for Democrats and the city in the redrawing of Congressional and legislative district lines.   B6    Repeal of Term Limits Rebuffed  A City Council committee, voting 5 to 4, rejected a move by some Council members to overturn term limits, dealing a severe, if not fatal, blow.   A1    Building Inspections Shake-Up  Mayor Giuliani said he would shift authority for building inspections to the Fire Department, moving to end what have been recurring cycles of corruption in the Buildings Department.

East Regional.   D1    OBITUARIES   A17    Cord Meyer Jr.  An articulate and passionate strategist who helped guide early C.I.A. efforts to contain Soviet communism at home and abroad, he was 80.   A17    BUSINESS DAY   C1-13    Tech Slowdown Overseas, Too  American technology companies, whose recent earnings declines in the United States have been softened by strong sales abroad, now appear to face a slowdown overseas as well.   C1    Compaq said it would cut 5,000 jobs and predicted that first-quarter earnings would be about one-third lower than expectations.   C6    Oracle's earnings met lowered projections, but the company warned that its fortunes could worsen before they rebounded.   C8    Dow Back Above 10,000  The Dow rose 57.82 points, to 10,031.28, and the S.& P. 500 eked out a small gain, but the Nasdaq slipped.   C8    Oil Cartel to Cut Production  OPEC is expected to announce a reduction in daily output by 700,000 to one million barrels, or up to 4 percent, to bolster declining prices.   C5    Airlines' Warning to Investors  The parent companies of United and American Airlines said a decline in passengers in a weakening economy would hurt first-quarter results.

And the attack wrought a combination of emotional wreckage and urgent pressure to sort out business issues involving billions of dollars.

" Fed Is Facing a Challenge In Rate-Cutting Campaign  After nine interest rate cuts this year, the Federal Reserve may be preparing to temper its campaign to revive the economy, analysts said. The Fed is all but certain to lower its benchmark rate today. But economists and investors are divided over whether the cut will be a half-percentage point or a quarter-point.    Whichever choice it makes, the Fed faces a series of tricky trade-offs. It is under pressure to bolster consumer confidence, support stock prices and be seen as responding aggressively to the surge in unemployment. At the same time, Fed officials are clearly concerned about overdoing their rate cuts.

" Shares of Enron Plunge On Doubts Over Merger  Shares of Enron plunged 23 percent as investors increasingly bet that Dynegy would either back out of its deal to buy Enron, the struggling energy trader, or seek to renegotiate terms of the acquisition.    Analysts said top officials of both companies had not known until the last few days that Enron faced a $690 million loan payment next week unless it came up with collateral. Enron's disclosure of the obligation -- along with new numbers about its cash squeeze -- raised fresh doubts among investors about Enron's controls and credibility, they said. [Page A1.]    Conoco Plays Security Card  As he leads the cheers for his company's planned merger with Phillips Petroleum, Conoco's chairman, Archie W. Dunham, has added a new rationale: energy security. He has highlighted the fact that the combined company would have more than 70 percent of its oil and gas reserves in the North Sea and North America. Analysts said Mr. Dunham's comments did not mean Conoco was abandoning its interest in places like Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. The language is aimed at regulators, politicians and the public, the analysts said, to persuade them to back the merger. Shares of Conoco rose 62 cents, to $26.60. Market Place.

" Central Bank President Predicts Upturn in Europe  The president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, voiced cautious optimism today about Europe's economy, predicting a moderate upturn during the next year.

"MURPHY -Charles H., 82. Died at his home in El Dorado, Arkansas March 20, 2002. His wife, Johnie Walker Murphy, preceded him in death; surviving him are: four children; Michael Walker Murphy, Martha Wilson Murphy, Charles Haywood Murphy, III, and Robert Madison Murphy; three sisters, Theodosia Murphy Nolan, Caroline Murphy Winter, and Bertie Murphy Smith; and eight grandchildren. He was born in El Dorado March 6, 1920, the son of Charles Haywood Murphy, Sr. and Bertie Wilson Murphy. Charles Murphy is best remembered as an oilman. His father had him manumitted by court order at the age of sixteen so he could legally transact business for himself, and he entered the petroleum industry on his own as an independent while still in his teens. At the age of twenty-one he assumed full managerial responsibility for his family's business, consisting primarily of oil production, farming and timber lands scattered across Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. For the next fifty-three years (except for three years' service in the U.S. Army infantry during World War II) he devoted his considerable energy to building this business into an international oil company that has been active on every continent except Antarctica. It is now a public company, of which the family still owns some 25%, and it still bears the family name, Murphy Oil Corporation. It is ranked by Fortune and Forbes magazines on some of their various measures as from the 312th to the 370th largest industrial concerns in the United States. Charles Murphy served this organization, under various titles, as its Chief Executive Officer until 1986 and continued as Chairman of the Board until 1994. While building Murphy Oil, Charles Murphy did not forsake his heritage as a banker. He succeeded his father as a major shareholder and dominant force in the First National Bank of El Dorado, which later became part of a group of banks owned by First United Bancshares, which Charles Murphy served as Chairman of the Board. This group of banks has now been succeeded by BancorpSouth Banc. Additionally, Murphy was a major investor in First Commercial Corporation, a significant regional bank holding company, where he served as Chairman of the Executive Committee. First Commercial has now become part of Regions Bank. Less public attention has been focused on Charles Murphy's career as an educator and philanthropist. This is the way he wanted it. He served seventeen years on the Arkansas Board of Higher Education, where he was instrumental in beginning the drive to improve the quality of public education in Arkansas. At the same time, he was dedicated to the improvement of private education as well, and gave generously of his time and money in this cause. He served ten years as a trustee of Hendrix College, where he and his family established the Hendrix Murphy Foundation, providing financial support to the institution. He also served on the Board of Administrators of Tulane University, where he and his family established the Tulane Murphy Foundation and the Murphy Institute of Political Economy. The Murphy Foundation, established by Charles Murphy, his wife, and his mother, provides financial support to both public and private institutions of learning, as well as scholarships to enable students to pursue higher education. For his service in the field of education, Murphy was recognized with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Arkansas in 1966. (continued next column)     Charles Murphy's service to education did not consist only of serving on boards and giving money. He was active as a teacher and lecturer, without fee, on a broad range of subjects, to a variety of audiences. Examples of the breadth and scope of his lectures include: ''The Effect of Environment on Business Strategy'' given at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, ''Energy Alternatives for the Mid21st Century'' at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., and ''Reading, Writing, and Thinking'' at El Dorado High School, El Dorado, Arkansas. That he was able to deal with such a range of subjects is due not only to his powerful intellect, but also to the manner of his education. His classroom education ended with his graduation from High School at Gulf Coast Military Academy at the age of sixteen, but his education continued throughout his life. As a young person he was taught languages, philosophy, history and science in the classical way by tutors, and as an adult he pursued his education by prodigious reading. Charles Murphy is recognized as a scholar by other scholars. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee, widow of the renowned historian, once introduced him as the only person who ever changed her husband's mind. Charles Murphy's public service encompassed more than the field of education. He served his country and his industry and often sought to bridge gaps between different points of view. He served ten years on the National Petroleum Council, including as its Chairman. The Council was established by the United States Government during World War II as a group of leading oilmen to advise the government on matters pertaining to strategic petroleum supply. He also served for ten years and chaired the American Petroleum Institute Conservation Liaison Committee. This committee laid the groundwork for some of today's far reaching petroleum industry environmental programs. For his service he received a citation for Outstanding Individual Service to Natural Resource Management from the National Wildlife Federation. Charles Murphy served his industry through membership on the American Petroleum Institute Board of Directors and its Executive Committee and Management Committee. This group honored him with election as President of its prestigious 25 Year Club and an honorary life membership on the Board of Directors. He was also instrumental in the founding of the National Ocean Industries Association, representing many diverse interests in the use and conservation of ocean resources. Like other facets of his life, Charles Murphy's public service board memberships reflect a broad range-in addition to those already mentioned, he has served on the Board of Governors of the Oschner Medical Foundation, the National Advisory Board of the Smithsonian Institution and the Louisiana Governor's Council on Economic Development. Charles Murphy was at ease with people from all walks of life, from Presidents and Prime Ministers, Kings and Princes, to roughnecks and roustabouts and service station attendants, and he was invariably courteous and charming to all. He was a citizen of the world, with friends and acquaintances in every part of the globe, but he never forgot his roots, his friends included Sam Rayburn, Lyndon Johnson, H. L. Hunt (and his family), Lloyd Bentsen and George Bush, of Texas; Russell Long, John McKeithen, Jimmy Noe, and Bennett Johnston, of Louisiana: Robert Kerr, Dean McGee, Carl Albert, and David Boren, of Oklahoma; and Witt and Jack Stephens, Chesley Pruet, John L. McClellan, William Fulbright, Wilbur Mills, Oren Harris, Sam Walton, Robert E. Lee Wilson, Dale Bumpers, David Pryor, Ray Thornton, Jay Dickey, Bill Clinton and Mike Huckabee, of Arkansas. He was on personal terms with every President of the United States from Truman to George W. Bush and his acquaintanceships extended to such diverse contemporary historic figures as James Schlessinger, Lady Margaret Thatcher and the Shah of Iran. When he discovered an oil field on tribal Indian land in Eastern Montana, he was inducted into the Assiniboine-Sioux Tribe and made a honorary chief, and he accepted this honor with the same grace as he accepted an honorary LLD from the University of Arkansas, the Roughneck of the Year Award from the American Petroleum Institute 25 Year Club, and an invitation to conduct a petroleum economics seminar for the National Iranian Oil Company following the Iranian Revolution. He responded with equal courtesy and thoughtfulness to requests for advice from Presidents, Cabinet Secretaries, OPEC Oil Ministers, and the widows of former employees. Charles Murphy left his mark on the times in which he lived. His son Madison said ''The world is left a much duller place by his passing.''","https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/24/classified/paid-notice-deaths-murphy-charles-h.html","","MURPHY -Charles H., 82.

" Schering-Plough Agrees To Pay $500 Million Fine  The drug maker Schering-Plough has agreed to pay a $500 million fine because of its repeated failure to fix problems in manufacturing dozens of drugs at four factories.

The agreement relates to violations dating as far back as 1998 that inspectors have found at plants in New Jersey and Puerto Rico.

" Judge Says California Owes Money to Power Sellers  A federal administrative law judge rejected claims by California for nearly $9 billion in refunds for what officials said was price gouging during the energy crisis of 2000-2001, and instead said the state owed $1.2 billion to cover unpaid electricity bills.     The judge, Bruce L. Birchman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, ruled that energy companies overcharged California about $1.8 billion during the crisis, but said the state had an unpaid balance of $3 billion, and thus actually owed the $1.2 billion difference. The ruling will be reviewed by the three-member commission.

It was called, rather grandly, the Future of Iraq Project. Among the topics was democracy, and among the Iraqis invited to join was a dissident named Kanan Makiya. He seemed a natural choice. In 1989, under the pseudonym Samir al-Khalil, Makiya published a book called ''Republic of Fear,'' which relentlessly dissected the totalitarian nature of Saddam's regime. The pseudonym wasn't a whim; in those years Iraq's overseas dissidents were frequently bumped off. Ignored upon publication, the book became a best seller the next year with the outbreak of the Persian Gulf war, and Makiya, the son of Iraq's most distinguished architect and a trained architect himself, was thrust into the turbulence of Middle Eastern politics. At the end of the war, during a forum at Harvard, the author revealed his identity for the first time and urged President George H.W. Bush to finish the job the war had left undone by getting rid of Saddam Hussein. Makiya's ideas cut deeply against the grain of Arab intellectual life and won him both powerful admirers and powerful enemies.","6","44","2003-03-02T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/1b4727fe-f6a4-5362-8cfd-a18afc181c59",7529,"nyt://article/1b4727fe-f6a4-5362-8cfd-a18afc181c59"

By the 10th century, Norse and Danish Vikings had touched in almost every navigable river of Western Europe from Germany to Spain. In addition to coastal raiding, the Norse were beginning the first open-ocean voyages from Europe, sailing direct to Iceland (800 miles) and even to Greenland (2,200 miles), which they colonized in the 10th century. At the beginning of the 10th century, Harold I united the petty kingdoms of western Scandinavia and extended his realm as far as the Orkney and Shetland islands. Viking nobles fleeing from his conquests consolided the Norse duchy of Normandy in France. Christianity was established under Olaf II at the beginning of the 11th century. Under Magnus VI (1263–80), medieval Norway reached the height of its power and prosperity. Norwegian independence ended with the accession in 1319 of Magnus VII, who was king of Sweden as well. Under the Kalmar Union of 1397, the three kingdoms of Scandinavia were merged under Danish control; Norway ceased to exist as a nation-state and was governed by the Danes for the following four centuries. In 1814 Denmark, which had sided with France in the Napoleonic wars, was forced by the victorious powers to cede Norway to Sweden. Under Sweden's military control Norway attempted to establish its own monarchy. The attempt failed, but in 1815 Sweden acknowledged the independence of Norway in perpetual union with the Swedish Crown. Relations between Norway and Sweden remained strained throughout the 19th century. In 1905 the Norwegian legislature, the Storting, declared the union void and deposed Swedish King Oscar II as king of Norway. Sweden acquiesced, and Prince Charles of Denmark was enthroned as king of Norway, ruling as Haakon VII for 52 years. During the 19th century, large numbers of Norwegians emigrated to North America. A rising tide of cultural nationalism was expressed in the flourishing Norwegian literature and art, as well as in a tradition of Arctic exploration. In the 20th century, industrialization, aided by the development of hydroelectric power, began to supplement Norway's traditional economic mainstays of fishing and seafaring. Norway remained neutral during World War I and was relatively unaffected by the postwar upheavals. Norway attempted to remain neutral in World War II as well but was invaded by German troops in April 1940; the country fell after a brief resistance aided by a Franco-British expeditionary force. The king and government fled to London and established a government-in-exile there. The Norwegian merchant marine fleet was also largely transferred to Great Britain and contributed to the Allied cause in the North Atlantic. At home, resistance grew to the collaborationist government of the Fascist leader Vidkun Quisling. As the Nazis retreated in 1945, King Haakon and his government returned home in triumph. Elections in 1945 returned a majority Labor government in the Storting. Labor set about establishing a Scandinavian welfare state, emphasizing privately owned, free-market industry, publicly owned utilities, state planning to ensure ample housing as well as full employment through export-oriented industries, a comprehensive social welfare system, and high taxes. Norway was a founding member of the United Nations and provided that body with its first secretary-general, Trygve Lie. With the hardening of the Cold War, Norway joined the NATO alliance in 1949. In 1959 Norway became one of the original members of the European Free Trade Association. Through the 1960's industrial development and exports continued to fuel an economic boom that led to great national prosperity and stability. The 1970's were the decade of oil and gas, with extensive development of North Sea fields. As international energy prices rose, the government's petroleum monopoly, Statoil, seemed to provide an endless source of funds. Because Norway's hydroelectric plants made the country self-sufficient in electric power, almost all of the oil and gas was available for export; by 1981 energy exports amounted to one-third, and by 1985 one-half, of Norway's total exports. The government expanded the welfare state and encouraged large wage increases. Public spending swelled and government debt mounted; meanwhile Norway became an economic hostage to OPEC oil prices. In the 1981 elections, the Conservative party formed a government for the first time since 1928; its austerity policy of holding down government spending while increasing taxes on consumer goods aroused popular opposition, and the government fell in 1986. The new Socialist coalition government faced even greater drops in oil revenues, combined with labor unrest and continued inflation. But in 1987 Norway negotiated the sale of gas to E.U. countries, and the recovery of energy prices brought a partial return to economic stability and prosperity. King Olav died in Jan. 1991; his son Harald V succeeded him in June. In 1993 the government of Prime Minister Brundtland sought admission to the E.U.. On Mar. 29, 1994, the E.U. agreed to admit Norway to membership after long and intricate negotiations limiting Spanish and Portuguese fishing rights in Norwegian waters. But Norweigian voters in a Nov. 1994 referendum rejected E.U. membership. Brundtland resigned in Oct. 1996 and was replaced by Thorbjoern Jagland, but he remained prime minister less than a year. After 1997 elections to the Storting, a right-wing three-party coalition, which controlled only 24 of the 165 seats, formed a government under Christian Democrat Kjell Magne Bondevik. Even Bondevik's three-week leave of absence (to treat depression) in Sept. 1998 failed to shake the stability of Norway's politics. But a March 2000 no-confidence vote toppled the government, replacing it with a Labor-Conservative coalition under Labor's Jens Stoltenberg as prime minister. Storting elections in Sept. 2001 brought another of western Europe's right-wing victories as Labor made its worst showing since 1924, losing 22 seats. Conservative Jens Stoltenberg became Norway's new prime minister.","https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/norway.html","GEOGRAPHY Location: western Scandinavian peninsula, northern Europe.

(13% Germany, 9% France, 7% Netherlands, 5% Benelux), 13% U.S. Early megalithic and Iron Age peoples of Britain, primarily Celtic, developed tribal states that were conquered by Roman invaders in A.D. 43. After Roman legions withdrew from Britain in 410, invasions of Jutes, Angles, and Saxons conquered much of England, while Celtic peoples flourished in Wales, Scotland, and especially Ireland. Viking invaders established settlements in the eighth century. A united Saxon kingdom fell to the Norman invasion of William the Conquerer in 1066. An aristocratic rebellion against the royal absolutism of King John in 1215 led to the royal acceptance of the Magna Carta, guaranteeing legal rights and laying the foundations of parliamentary government. From the 12th to the 15th century, the Plantagenet dynasty ruled England and claimed overlordship over Ireland; Wales was conquered in 1283. The Plantagenets also controlled sizable territories in France. The Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) cost England its French possessions; the War of the Roses, (1455–85) ended the Plantagenet dynasty and brought Henry Tudor (Henry VII) to the throne. The Tudors gradually centralized royal control by bringing pressure against both the church and the nobility. Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534 and established the Church of England. Under Elizabeth I, the last of the Tudors, England defeated Spain at sea and laid the foundations of later worldwide English sea power. The English Renaissance began under Elizabeth I (1533–1603) with the works of Shakespeare and continued into the 17th century with Milton and Newton. The Stuart dynasty was founded by James I (1566–1625), uniting the crowns of England and Scotland in 1603. The English Civil War (1642–49) culminated in the execution of Charles I and the proclamation of the Commonwealth (later the Protectorate) under Oliver Cromwell. The monarchy was restored with Charles II in 1660. In the bloodless Glorious Revolution (1688), James II fled before a Protestant army under the Dutch William of Orange, who married and ruled jointly with James's daughter Mary II. The English Bill of Rights established the supremacy of Parliament and made the government a model of constitutional monarchy. In the last gasp of the Stuart claimants to the throne, Irish supporters of James II were defeated at the Battle of the Boyne (1690), which temporarily crushed Irish resistance to annexation by England. The United Kingdom was created when Scotland was joined with England in a common Parliament by the Act of Union in 1707. A Scottish uprising led by the Young Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart, was crushed at Culloden Moor in 1745. Ireland was made part of the United Kingdom in 1801. In the 1700's the United Kingdom became the greatest sea power in the world, controlling an empire that included much of North America and India. Agrarian “enclosures” of the 18th century ruined the peasantry but created an entrepreneurial revolution in agriculture that ultimately led to greatly increased agricultural productivity. The capital created in the process contributed to the success of the Industrial Revolution, which over the next century made England the wealthiest land on earth. Despite the loss of the 13 colonies after the American Revolution (1775–83), England consolidated its holdings in the Indian subcontinent, Australia and New Zealand, Malaya, Hong Kong, much of eastern Africa from “Cape to Cairo,” and elsewhere. Britain's prosperity and moral purpose were embodied in the person of Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland (1836–1901) and Empress of India (from 1836). The repeal of the protectionist Corn Laws in 1846 led to an agricultural depression and hastened the migration of labor from the countryside to the industrial cities. The rise of labor activism led in 1906 to laws granting privileged status to trade unions, which organized the Labour party to promote their interests. Britain's involvement in the Triple Entente with France and Russia ensured its participation in World War I (1914–18) against Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary. Victory came at the cost of an entire generation of British youth, but Britain emerged from the war with its empire at a high point, adding Tanganyika, Jordan, Palestine, and Iraq as part of the postwar division of spoils. Most of Ireland became independent in 1921, however, leaving only Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. Between the two world wars, Britain's navy and air force were the largest in the world, its army the third largest. Yet its industry was aging, the Great Depression hit especially hard in the British Isles, strikes and labor unrest weakened the social fabric, and colonial ties began to weaken in the 1930's. Economic retrenchment led to a failure to rearm in the face of the rising threat of Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. The Munich Pact of 1938 gave Hitler a license for war; his invasion of Poland in 1939 forced Britain into the conflict. When Winston Churchill became prime minister in 1940, Britain was under daily air attack and in danger of an invasion by sea, and the country was dependent on American friendship and lend-lease war materials. But 1941 brought alliance with the United States and the Soviet Union, and a slowly turning tide of war leading to victory in 1945. Still, postwar Britain dropped to the second rank of superpowers. The coalition between the Conservative and Labour parties that had governed Great Britain during the war seemed no longer necessary in 1945 as the war wound down. Labour won a landslide victory in the 1945 elections; Churchill was recalled in the midst of the Potsdam Conference, and Clement Atlee became prime minister. A brief Labour flirtation with the U.S.S.R. quickly ended in the postwar 1940's; England became a founding member of the United Nations and also, in 1949, of NATO. As the Cold War took shape, Britain developed its own nuclear arsenal. The Labour party nationalized the Bank of England along with railroads, public utilities, and heavy industry. A comprehensive welfare state apparatus was created, including a national health service, unemployment and retirement benefits, and free education at all levels. But Britain was in many respects too poor to afford such changes; in order to cut expenditures, the government hastened the process of withdrawal from colonies and military bases around the world. India was granted independence in 1947, and Palestine, Burma, and Ceylon in 1948–49. The elections of 1951 brought Churchill back to the prime ministership at the head of a Conservative majority that would last for 13 years. The Conservatives returned steel and trucking to the private sector but in general refrained from undoing the social policies of their Labour predecessors. Economic growth began in the 1950's and held steady at about 2.5 percent per year, a significantly lower rate than in continental Europe; obsolescence, excessive wage and benefit settlements, and a low savings rate all took their toll. The coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 added a much-needed element of national celebration. Churchill retired in 1955 and was succeeded by Anthony Eden. Eden's government fell in 1956 over the failed Anglo-French invasion of Suez. Eden's fall in 1957 brought to power Harold Macmillan, who pursued close relations with the United States. Most important, he presided over the transformation of an empire to a commonwealth; in the early 1960's, Ghana, Nigeria, Malaya, Singapore, and numerous other colonies were granted independence and Commonwealth status. Immigrants from the Commonwealth promptly flocked to England, straining housing, social services, and the labor market and creating problems of assimilation that remain unsolved. Britain under Macmillan was the moving force behind the European Free Trade Association in 1960. In 1961 Britain applied for membership in the EEC, but that application was humiliatingly vetoed by France's Charles de Gaulle in 1963. Macmillan's government fell with the Profumo Scandal of 1963, and Douglas Home became a caretaker prime minister pending new elections. The 1964 elections brought the Labour party to power under Harold Wilson, whose moderate positions made him unpopular with his own party, especially when he sponsored legislation to ban wildcat strikes. Strikes, wage inflation, the steady growth of the public sector (including renationalization of the steel industry), and the rise of turmoil in Northern Ireland in 1968–69 combined to make public support for Labour evaporate. The Conservative victory in the 1970 elections brought Edward Heath to the office of prime minister. Promising to cut expenditures and taxes, reward initiative, and curb union power, the Conservatives were able to accomplish none of those aims. Heath's government imposed ineffective wage controls in an attempt to slow inflation and passed the 1971 Industrial Relations Act to regulate unions. When unions defied that act, the government fell. Heath's major achievement was the United Kingdom's admission to the EC in 1973. Continued turmoil in Northern Ireland was met with the abolition of Ulster's Stormount Parliament in 1972 and the imposition of direct British rule—a policy that did nothing to stem the growing sectarian violence. Wilson returned to the prime ministership in 1974 and retired in 1976, passing on the office to James Callaghan, who governed until 1979 at the head of a Labour-Liberal coalition. The continued power of trade unions was seen in the repeal of the Industrial Relations Act and the extension of union privileges. The left wing of the Labour party brought increasing pressure against defense spending, membership in NATO, and also loudly criticized American involvement in Vietnam. The OPEC oil price rises of 1972–74 hurt Great Britain in the short run but also encouraged development of oil and gas fields in the North Sea, which made the nation a major petroleum exporter and helped revitalize its economy. Oil exploration in the North Sea also encouraged Scottish nationalism, with some damage to national unity, although in both Scotland and Wales, proposals in 1979 for separate parliaments were soundly defeated by plebiscites. The 1979 elections brought the Conservatives to power again, behind Margaret Thatcher, Great Britain's (and Europe's) first female prime minister. She proved to be the only British prime minister in modern times to lead her party successfully in three elections. Thatcher took office with an agenda that involved undoing much of the course of postwar British history. The first target was inflation, attacked through a freeze on expenditures and reduction of government borrowing. The policy was a success; inflation fell from 18 percent in 1980 to 3 percent in 1989. But the austerity program had a high cost in unemployment, which remained at 14 percent in the mid-1980's. In 1982 national attention turned abruptly to overseas concerns, as Argentina invaded the Falkland (“Malvinas”) Islands (only 300 miles east of Argentina), which it had long claimed as Argentine national territory, on Apr. 2. On May 21 British forces launched a counteroffensive, and the invading Argentine forces surrendered on June 14. The nation's success in mounting an amphibious operation 6,500 miles away provoked an upsurge of patriotism that swept Thatcher's party into a second term in 1983. After the election the government turned to denationalization of industry. Over $30 billion in state property—from industrial giants, such as Britoil and British Gas, to individual apartments in municipal housing projects—was sold to private interests. This program was followed in 1986 by tax cuts, in which the top income-tax rate dropped from 98 percent to 40 percent. In foreign affairs, Britain agreed in 1985 to return Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The 1987 elections pitted the Conservatives against a weak Labour party that opposed NATO missile deployment in Great Britain, advocating unilateral disarmament and calling for renationalization of industry and a return to higher taxes for the wealthy. The Conservatives easily won their third straight election. By 1989 the “Thatcher Revolution” had produced a decisive long-term economic recovery, but one that was unevenly distributed: the southern part of the country enjoyed an economic boom, while the older industrial cities of the north remained stagnant. In 1990 an economic slowdown and rising inflation led to a strong decline in support for Mrs. Thatcher and her government. She resigned in November 1990. Thatcher was replaced by Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, whose greatest challenge has been Britain's role in a united Europe, to which Britain now has a land link via the 31-mile Channel Tunnel (Chunnel), completed in 1994. In the April 1992 elections, the Conservatives, led by Major, won a comfortable 21-seat margin in Parliament despite a recession. Not since the Napoleonic Wars has a British political party been able to form four consecutive governments. Yet only 13 months later Major's ratings in the polls had fallen to 21 percent as the economy stalled and the Conservatives themselves split badly over some elements in the E.C.'s Maastricht Treaty. The Conservatives were further beset in 1994 with a series of tabloid scandals and allegations of political corruption concerning arms sales to Iraq and Malaysia. Conservative chances in parliamentary elections, due in the spring of 1997, were looking very slim, and they looked worse in March after the government clumsily handled the news that scientists had concluded that eating English beef could cause the fatal “mad-cow” disease. After insisting that there was no cause for alarm the government was forced to deal with an E.U. boycott. The parliamentary election of May 1997 ended 18 years of Tory government with Labour winning its largest majority since 1935, 419 seats to the Conservatives 165. The new Prime Minister Tony Blair appointed a cabinet of political moderates. In 1997 Hong Kong was returned to China without incident and in April 1998 the Blair government succeeded in negotiating a settlement in Northern Ireland although problems still remain. In May 1999 the first elections to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly were held. Labour won a plurality in both (over nationalist parties). The two bodies have authority over education, environment, health care, housing, and law enforcement. The Scottish Parliament also possesses authority to tax. In the 2001 elections Blair's Labour Party won a huge victory, taking 413 of 659 seats, the first time Labour had won two consecutive victories. Still, in local elections in May 2002 and 2003, the Conservatives trounced labor. The vote on invading Iraq carried overwhelmingly (412–143); yet in the aftermath of victory serious troubles arose for the Blair government over the intelligence accounts used to justify British participation.","https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/united-kingdom.html","GEOGRAPHY Location: northwestern Europe, occupying major portion of British Isles.

After Roman legions withdrew from Britain in 410, invasions of Jutes, Angles, and Saxons conquered much of England, while Celtic peoples flourished in Wales, Scotland, and especially Ireland. Viking invaders established settlements in the eighth century. A united Saxon kingdom fell to the Norman invasion of William the Conquerer in 1066. An aristocratic rebellion against the royal absolutism of King John in 1215 led to the royal acceptance of the Magna Carta, guaranteeing legal rights and laying the foundations of parliamentary government. From the 12th to the 15th century, the Plantagenet dynasty ruled England and claimed overlordship over Ireland; Wales was conquered in 1283. The Plantagenets also controlled sizable territories in France. The Hundred Years' War (1337&#x2013;1453) cost England its French possessions; the War of the Roses, (1455&#x2013;85) ended the Plantagenet dynasty and brought Henry Tudor (Henry VII) to the throne. The Tudors gradually centralized royal control by bringing pressure against both the church and the nobility. Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534 and established the Church of England. Under Elizabeth I, the last of the Tudors, England defeated Spain at sea and laid the foundations of later worldwide English sea power. The English Renaissance began under Elizabeth I (1533&#x2013;1603) with the works of Shakespeare and continued into the 17th century with Milton and Newton. The Stuart dynasty was founded by James I (1566&#x2013;1625), uniting the crowns of England and Scotland in 1603. The English Civil War (1642&#x2013;49) culminated in the execution of Charles I and the proclamation of the Commonwealth (later the Protectorate) under Oliver Cromwell. The monarchy was restored with Charles II in 1660. In the bloodless Glorious Revolution (1688), James II fled before a Protestant army under the Dutch William of Orange, who married and ruled jointly with James's daughter Mary II. The English Bill of Rights established the supremacy of Parliament and made the government a model of constitutional monarchy. In the last gasp of the Stuart claimants to the throne, Irish supporters of James II were defeated at the Battle of the Boyne (1690), which temporarily crushed Irish resistance to annexation by England. The United Kingdom was created when Scotland was joined with England in a common Parliament by the Act of Union in 1707. A Scottish uprising led by the Young Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart, was crushed at Culloden Moor in 1745. Ireland was made part of the United Kingdom in 1801. In the 1700's the United Kingdom became the greatest sea power in the world, controlling an empire that included much of North America and India. Agrarian &#x201C;enclosures&#x201D; of the 18th century ruined the peasantry but created an entrepreneurial revolution in agriculture that ultimately led to greatly increased agricultural productivity. The capital created in the process contributed to the success of the Industrial Revolution, which over the next century made England the wealthiest land on earth. Despite the loss of the 13 colonies after the American Revolution (1775&#x2013;83), England consolidated its holdings in the Indian subcontinent, Australia and New Zealand, Malaya, Hong Kong, much of eastern Africa from &#x201C;Cape to Cairo,&#x201D; and elsewhere. Britain's prosperity and moral purpose were embodied in the person of Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland (1836&#x2013;1901) and Empress of India (from 1836). The repeal of the protectionist Corn Laws in 1846 led to an agricultural depression and hastened the migration of labor from the countryside to the industrial cities. The rise of labor activism led in 1906 to laws granting privileged status to trade unions, which organized the Labour party to promote their interests. Britain's involvement in the Triple Entente with France and Russia ensured its participation in World War I (1914&#x2013;18) against Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary. Victory came at the cost of an entire generation of British youth, but Britain emerged from the war with its empire at a high point, adding Tanganyika, Jordan, Palestine, and Iraq as part of the postwar division of spoils. Most of Ireland became independent in 1921, however, leaving only Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. Between the two world wars, Britain's navy and air force were the largest in the world, its army the third largest. Yet its industry was aging, the Great Depression hit especially hard in the British Isles, strikes and labor unrest weakened the social fabric, and colonial ties began to weaken in the 1930's. Economic retrenchment led to a failure to rearm in the face of the rising threat of Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. The Munich Pact of 1938 gave Hitler a license for war; his invasion of Poland in 1939 forced Britain into the conflict. When Winston Churchill became prime minister in 1940, Britain was under daily air attack and in danger of an invasion by sea, and the country was dependent on American friendship and lend-lease war materials. But 1941 brought alliance with the United States and the Soviet Union, and a slowly turning tide of war leading to victory in 1945. Still, postwar Britain dropped to the second rank of superpowers. The coalition between the Conservative and Labour parties that had governed Great Britain during the war seemed no longer necessary in 1945 as the war wound down. Labour won a landslide victory in the 1945 elections; Churchill was recalled in the midst of the Potsdam Conference, and Clement Atlee became prime minister. A brief Labour flirtation with the U.S.S.R. quickly ended in the postwar 1940's; England became a founding member of the United Nations and also, in 1949, of NATO. As the Cold War took shape, Britain developed its own nuclear arsenal. The Labour party nationalized the Bank of England along with railroads, public utilities, and heavy industry. A comprehensive welfare state apparatus was created, including a national health service, unemployment and retirement benefits, and free education at all levels. But Britain was in many respects too poor to afford such changes; in order to cut expenditures, the government hastened the process of withdrawal from colonies and military bases around the world. India was granted independence in 1947, and Palestine, Burma, and Ceylon in 1948&#x2013;49. The elections of 1951 brought Churchill back to the prime ministership at the head of a Conservative majority that would last for 13 years. The Conservatives returned steel and trucking to the private sector but in general refrained from undoing the social policies of their Labour predecessors. Economic growth began in the 1950's and held steady at about 2.5 percent per year, a significantly lower rate than in continental Europe; obsolescence, excessive wage and benefit settlements, and a low savings rate all took their toll. The coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 added a much-needed element of national celebration. Churchill retired in 1955 and was succeeded by Anthony Eden. Eden's government fell in 1956 over the failed Anglo-French invasion of Suez. Eden's fall in 1957 brought to power Harold Macmillan, who pursued close relations with the United States. Most important, he presided over the transformation of an empire to a commonwealth; in the early 1960's, Ghana, Nigeria, Malaya, Singapore, and numerous other colonies were granted independence and Commonwealth status. Immigrants from the Commonwealth promptly flocked to England, straining housing, social services, and the labor market and creating problems of assimilation that remain unsolved. Britain under Macmillan was the moving force behind the European Free Trade Association in 1960. In 1961 Britain applied for membership in the EEC, but that application was humiliatingly vetoed by France's Charles de Gaulle in 1963. Macmillan's government fell with the Profumo Scandal of 1963, and Douglas Home became a caretaker prime minister pending new elections. The 1964 elections brought the Labour party to power under Harold Wilson, whose moderate positions made him unpopular with his own party, especially when he sponsored legislation to ban wildcat strikes. Strikes, wage inflation, the steady growth of the public sector (including renationalization of the steel industry), and the rise of turmoil in Northern Ireland in 1968&#x2013;69 combined to make public support for Labour evaporate. The Conservative victory in the 1970 elections brought Edward Heath to the office of prime minister. Promising to cut expenditures and taxes, reward initiative, and curb union power, the Conservatives were able to accomplish none of those aims. Heath's government imposed ineffective wage controls in an attempt to slow inflation and passed the 1971 Industrial Relations Act to regulate unions. When unions defied that act, the government fell. Heath's major achievement was the United Kingdom's admission to the EC in 1973. Continued turmoil in Northern Ireland was met with the abolition of Ulster's Stormount Parliament in 1972 and the imposition of direct British rule&#x2014;a policy that did nothing to stem the growing sectarian violence. Wilson returned to the prime ministership in 1974 and retired in 1976, passing on the office to James Callaghan, who governed until 1979 at the head of a Labour-Liberal coalition. The continued power of trade unions was seen in the repeal of the Industrial Relations Act and the extension of union privileges. The left wing of the Labour party brought increasing pressure against defense spending, membership in NATO, and also loudly criticized American involvement in Vietnam. The OPEC oil price rises of 1972&#x2013;74 hurt Great Britain in the short run but also encouraged development of oil and gas fields in the North Sea, which made the nation a major petroleum exporter and helped revitalize its economy. Oil exploration in the North Sea also encouraged Scottish nationalism, with some damage to national unity, although in both Scotland and Wales, proposals in 1979 for separate parliaments were soundly defeated by plebiscites. The 1979 elections brought the Conservatives to power again, behind Margaret Thatcher, Great Britain's (and Europe's) first female prime minister. She proved to be the only British prime minister in modern times to lead her party successfully in three elections. Thatcher took office with an agenda that involved undoing much of the course of postwar British history. The first target was inflation, attacked through a freeze on expenditures and reduction of government borrowing. The policy was a success; inflation fell from 18 percent in 1980 to 3 percent in 1989. But the austerity program had a high cost in unemployment, which remained at 14 percent in the mid-1980's. In 1982 national attention turned abruptly to overseas concerns, as Argentina invaded the Falkland (&#x201C;Malvinas&#x201D;) Islands (only 300 miles east of Argentina), which it had long claimed as Argentine national territory, on Apr. 2. On May 21 British forces launched a counteroffensive, and the invading Argentine forces surrendered on June 14. The nation's success in mounting an amphibious operation 6,500 miles away provoked an upsurge of patriotism that swept Thatcher's party into a second term in 1983. After the election the government turned to denationalization of industry. Over $30 billion in state property&#x2014;from industrial giants, such as Britoil and British Gas, to individual apartments in municipal housing projects&#x2014;was sold to private interests. This program was followed in 1986 by tax cuts, in which the top income-tax rate dropped from 98 percent to 40 percent. In foreign affairs, Britain agreed in 1985 to return Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The 1987 elections pitted the Conservatives against a weak Labour party that opposed NATO missile deployment in Great Britain, advocating unilateral disarmament and calling for renationalization of industry and a return to higher taxes for the wealthy. The Conservatives easily won their third straight election. By 1989 the &#x201C;Thatcher Revolution&#x201D; had produced a decisive long-term economic recovery, but one that was unevenly distributed: the southern part of the country enjoyed an economic boom, while the older industrial cities of the north remained stagnant. In 1990 an economic slowdown and rising inflation led to a strong decline in support for Mrs. Thatcher and her government. She resigned in November 1990. Thatcher was replaced by Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, whose greatest challenge has been Britain's role in a united Europe, to which Britain now has a land link via the 31-mile Channel Tunnel (Chunnel), completed in 1994. In the April 1992 elections, the Conservatives, led by Major, won a comfortable 21-seat margin in Parliament despite a recession. Not since the Napoleonic Wars has a British political party been able to form four consecutive governments. Yet only 13 months later Major's ratings in the polls had fallen to 21 percent as the economy stalled and the Conservatives themselves split badly over some elements in the E.C.'s Maastricht Treaty. The Conservatives were further beset in 1994 with a series of tabloid scandals and allegations of political corruption concerning arms sales to Iraq and Malaysia. Conservative chances in parliamentary elections, due in the spring of 1997, were looking very slim, and they looked worse in March after the government clumsily handled the news that scientists had concluded that eating English beef could cause the fatal &#x201C;mad-cow&#x201D; disease.

Major trading partners: exports: 61% E.U., 9% U.S.; imports: 59% E.U., 9% U.S. Pre-Roman France, known as Gaul, was populated by Celtic tribes. The Mediterranean coast, colonized by Phoenician and Greek traders, was conquered by Rome in the second century B.C. The Roman conquest of all of Gaul was carried out by Julius Caesar between 58 and 51 B.C. Gaul became a prosperous and thoroughly Latinized province of the Roman Empire and Christianity was introduced in the first century A.D. Barbarian invaders including Visigoths, Franks, and Burgundii swept through France in the fifth century. In 486 Clovis, chief of the Franks, unified the country, accepted Christianity, and established the Merovingian dynasty. France was invaded by Muslim Saracens in the seventh century, but in 732 Charles Martel defeated the Saracens. His son, Pepin the Short, overthrew the last Merovingian ruler in 751 and proclaimed himself king. Pepin's son, Charlemagne, greatly expanded his kingdom and was crowned emperor of the West by the pope in 800. Ninth-century Viking invasions greatly weakened the power of the Carolingians and France broke up into estates, some of them effectively independent countries, ruled by great aristocrats. Among the most important were the duke- doms of Aquitaine and Burgundy and the counties of Flanders, Blois, and Anjou. In 911 the Vikings, who had repeatedly raided the Atlantic coast of France, established the duchy of Normandy. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty died out in France (although it survived in the Holy Roman Empire) and was replaced by a new line, the Capetians. Steadily expanding in both territory and power from their base in Paris, the Capetians solidified the foundations of the French monarchy. Paris became a great monastic and university city as well as a center of trade and manufacturing. Under the crusader-king Louis IX (St. Louis), France also became an international power. During the 14th century, the Black Death, peasant rebellions, and the beginning of the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) with England further weakened the French monarchy. The Norman conquest of England in 1066 had entwined the fortunes of the French and English monarchies, and with the Capetian line in decline, England pursued its claims in France. Henry V of England defeated the French at Agincourt in 1415, and in 1420 Charles IV made Henry heir to the throne of France. Henry's forces were defeated by French armies inspired by Joan of Arc, and in 1429 his claim to the French throne was overturned. In 1435 Burgundy allied itself with France, and in 1453 the English were driven out of France, except for an enclave at Calais. Louis XI completed the consolidation of France under the French monarchy. France prospered as a center of commerce, industry, agriculture, learning, and culture throughout the 16th century but was disrupted by religious civil wars stemming from the Reformation. The Protestant Henry of Navarre, heir to the throne, was obliged to accept Catholicism before being crowned in 1594; he became founder of the Bourbon monarchy. The consolidation of power under a highly centralized monarchy continued under Henry's heirs. With a foreign policy shaped by the powerful prime ministers Cardinal Richelieu and Cardinal Mazarin, France under Louis XIII and Louis XIV enhanced its stature in Europe by defeating the Habsburgs in the Thirty Years' War (1618–48). Louis XIV—the Sun King—moved the court from Paris to his new palace at Versailles and presided over the wealthiest and most powerful monarchy in Europe. His persecution of the Huguenots resulted in a great emigration of Protestants from France. A grand alliance of European states thwarted France's expansionist aims on the continent, but France became a major colonial power in North America, controlling Canada and Louisiana (including most of the Mississippi-Missouri valley), and pursued overseas ventures in Africa and Asia as well. In the mid-18th century, France was weakened internationally by the expensive and fruitless Wars of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War. Under the Treaty of Paris (1763), France ceded control of Canada to Great Britain. The Enlightenment made France a world center of intellectual activity but also led to the questioning of the political and social bases of the French monarchy. An increasingly wealthy but powerless bourgeoisie chafed under the restrictions of an archaic socioeconomic order. France under Louis XVI supported the American colonies in the Revolutionary War, incurring a large public debt in the process. Combined with unrestrained extravagance on the part of the court and the aristocracy, poverty increased among the rural peasantry and the urban working class, while the bourgeoisie demanded a greater voice in government. These trends came to a head with the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789; soon thereafter, the Estates-General took control of the country, and France was in the throes of revolution. Revolutionary leaders at first allowed Louis XVI to remain on the throne in a limited monarchy, but the king and Marie Antoinette were subsequently tried for treason and executed in 1793. Thousands died during the Reign of Terror which continued until July 1794, ending with the execution of its primary architects, Augustin Robespierre and Georges Danton. The Directory, with five heads of each division of government (1795–99), failed to maintain public order and suffered military reverses in foreign wars in which successive revolutionary governments had been embroiled since 1792. On Nov. 9, 1799, the Directory was overthrown by the Consulate, with Napoleon Bonaparte named first consul. Napoleon proclaimed himself emperor of France in 1804. He transformed French law through the Code Napoleon and initially expanded the French empire in Europe and the Middle East. Suffering repeated reverses against British naval forces and disastrous losses in his 1812 invasion of Russia, Napoleon was defeated by the British under Wellington at Waterloo in 1815, and the French empire collapsed. France restored its monarchy in 1815 but not its monarchical absolutism. Charles X, successor to Louis XVIII, was ousted in a coup d'état in 1830 and replaced by the liberal Louis Philippe. The monarchy came to an end in the wave of popular revolt that swept France, along with most of Europe, in 1848; Louis Napoleon (nephew of Bonaparte) became president of the Second Republic. In 1852 he created the Second Empire, ruling as Napoleon III and presiding over a court that set the standards of fashion for the wealthy bourgeois society of 19th-century Europe. During the 19th century, France again became a major colonial power, acquiring important possessions in North and West Africa and Indochina. It also became a world leader in art, science, and literature and began its slow transformation into a major industrial power. Politically, however, France suffered from endemic weakness. The Second Empire ended disastrously with defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71; the Paris Commune, formed during that war, was overthrown with great bloodshed. The Third Republic (1871–1914), despite the glittering pleasures of the Belle Epoque and France's prestige as a world power, was shaken by the Dreyfus Affair of 1894–1906. France joined with Great Britain and Russia in forming the Triple Entente of 1907, a defensive agreement against the Triple Alliance of Germany, Italy, and the Austro-Hungarian empire. During World War I—in effect a war between these two alliances—France suffered millions of casualties and severe damage in the north. Although its role as a leader of the victorious alliance was confirmed at the Versailles Conference of 1919, France was seriously weakened by the war and played a diminished role as a world power. France suffered badly in the world depression of the 1930's and could muster neither political nor military energy to offer effective opposition to the rise of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. France was a participant in the Munich Agreement of 1938, which sealed the fate of central Europe. When World War II broke out in 1939, Hitler initially held off his attack on France, but when it came in May-June 1940, France was swiftly and ignominiously defeated. During World War II, northern France was under German occupation, while in the south a collaborationist, semifascistic state was organized, with its capital at Vichy. Meanwhile, in London, Gen. Charles de Gaulle rallied the Free French forces, which fought on the Allied side in various campaigns. After the liberation of Paris a “provisional government” of various Resistance groups combined with de Gaulle's supporters drew up a constitution for the Fourth French Republic. Although it suffered from inherent political weaknesses and often failed to provide stable cabinets, the Fourth Republic presided over postwar recovery, aided by the Marshall Plan; it promoted a mixed socialist-free enterprise economy and instituted social reforms such as women's suffrage and social security. It also led the way toward a united Europe, playing a leading role in the organization of the EEC in 1957. France became a founding member of NATO in 1949. The Fourth Republic was unable, however, to withstand the strains of the dismantling of France's empire during the postwar wave of decolonization. France's recovery of Indochina in 1945 set off a war of national liberation there that lasted until France withdrew from the colony in 1954. Morocco and Tunisia won their independence in 1956; in Algeria, regarded as part of France itself, France fought on against Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN) rebels. The Algerian War seriously polarized French public opinion, and, threatened with an army coup, the National Assembly voted in 1958 to grant Pres. Charles de Gaulle emergency powers for six months. De Gaulle outmaneuvered his army backers and negotiated to turn Algeria over to the FLN, a process completed in 1962. Meanwhile he also restored order at home and presided over the drafting of a new constitution that created the Fifth Republic in 1958. The new constitution created a strong presidency, with powers to name the premier and the Council of Ministers and to preside over their meetings. The legislature was required to give priority to government initiatives and lacked authority over national defense, education, labor, and local government. Under the governments of premiers Michel Debré and Georges Pompidou, the Gaullist regime further advanced modernization of French industry and greatly benefited French agriculture by expanding the Common Market to include agricultural goods. De Gaulle followed an independent foreign policy, pursuing European integration as well as closer relations with the Communist bloc and the Third World. He blocked British entry into the Common Market; developed an independent nuclear force, refusing to sign nuclear test-ban and nonproliferation treaties; pursued a historic rapprochement with Germany; recognized the People's Republic of China; established a leading French role in the former French colonies of Africa; and withdrew French forces from the NATO military command. Reelected president in 1965, after a runoff election against the Socialist-Communist alliance candidate François Mitterrand, de Gaulle continued his independent policy until student riots in early 1968 provoked police repression, which led to further popular support for the students, especially in Paris. De Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and, in an emotional campaign on behalf of national stability, won a large electoral majority. In 1969, however, following minor political reverses, de Gaulle resigned as president. The elections of June 1969 gave the presidency to former premier Georges Pompidou, who died in office in April 1974. He was succeeded by the Independent Republican Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who served until May 1981. During these years the Gaullist heritage was developed and consolidated. In foreign policy the movement toward European unity continued with the development of the European Parliament and, in a reversal of policy in 1973, French support for British membership in the EEC. The economic shock of the OPEC price rises of 1973–74 led to a decision to stress new industrial ventures in high-technology fields, symbolized by the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic transport. The 1970's were years of social ferment, with a relaxation of divorce laws and the legalization of contraception advertisements and abortion, and a decline in church membership and attendance. In 1978 disillusionment stemming from inflation and social difficulties under Giscard d'Estaing brought about a leftist electoral victory for the first time under the Fifth Republic. The Gaullist era came to an end in 1981, when Socialist François Mitterrand defeated Giscard in a presidential election. He dissolved the National Assembly and led his party to an absolute majority. Socialist premier Pierre Mauroy formed a government which pursued an aggressive program of nationalization of banks and major industries and reform of local government. Continued economic difficulties led to a loss of popular support for Mitterrand's policies. In the elections of 1986, Jacques Chirac's coalition of Gaullists and Giscardists won an almost absolute majority in the National Assembly, and Chirac became premier—the first time since 1958 that the president and the premier were of opposing parties. An accommodation was worked out in which Mitterrand concentrated on foreign affairs, and Chirac on domestic matters. Mitterrand oversaw a restoration of French military cooperation with NATO and a continuation of Franco-German cooperation. At home Chirac and his party reversed Mitterrand's policy of nationalization, cut taxes, and brought about a significant reduction in the inflation rate. Chirac ran for president against Mitterrand in 1988 but was defeated. Mitterrand's reelection with over 54 percent of the vote carried his Socialist party to a near majority in the assembly, where they constructed a coalition government. Persistent 9 percent unemployment and the growing appeal of Jean-Marie Le Pen's anti-immigrant National Front brought a cabinet shake-up in May 1991 and the designation of France's first female premier, Edith Cresson. But the shake-up did nothing to stem voter dissatisfaction with the governing Socialists. Elections to regional councils in 1992 saw the Socialist vote drop to 18 percent, but not to the benefit of the center-right coalition Union for France, which gained only one-third of the vote. The National Front and the two rival “green” parties together gained 28 percent of the vote. Mitterand strongly supported U.N. intervention in the Balkans and France's participation in the Maastricht Treaty. But not even the formidable Mitterand could prevent the Socialist rout in the March 1993 assembly elections. The Rally for France won the most lopsided victory in the republic's history, carrying 460 (of 577) seats while the left took only 93. Rejecting calls for his resignation, Mitterand reasserted his constitutional prerogatives in defense and foreign policy, vowing to stay on until 1995, when his unprecedented 14-year presidency ended as Jacques Chirac won over Lionel Jospin. Pledged to tax and spending cuts and continued dismantling of state enterprises, Chirac and his followers met with limited success as unemployment reached its highest level ever. A giant truckers' strike blocked French highways without government action, and cutting social welfare spending (to meet the E.U.'s Euro conditions) proved elusive. So, seeking a public mandate for France's participation in the Euro, Chirac dissolved the Assembly a year early. But the result was yet another French “cohabitation”: the left coalition took 319 seats and Lionel Jospin became prime minister. In May 1999 the Jospin government narrowly survived a censure motion over its handling of separatist unrest on Corsica. In a referendum in Sept. 2000, voters—only 30 percent of the electorate—gave their approval to reducing the term of the president from seven to five years. Jospin's run for the presidency ended in embarrassment as he finished third to Pres. Chirac and the unimportant troublemaker Jean-Marie LePen, Chirac polling 82 percent in the run-off. In June Chirac's right wing coalition took 355 of the National Assembly's 577 seats, promising to support “law and order,” cut taxes, and privatize the elephantine state pension system. In 2003 Chirac played a leading role in condemning the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.","https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/france.html","GEOGRAPHY Location: western Europe.

The Mediterranean coast, colonized by Phoenician and Greek traders, was conquered by Rome in the second century B.C. The Roman conquest of all of Gaul was carried out by Julius Caesar between 58 and 51 B.C. Gaul became a prosperous and thoroughly Latinized province of the Roman Empire and Christianity was introduced in the first century A.D. Barbarian invaders including Visigoths, Franks, and Burgundii swept through France in the fifth century. In 486 Clovis, chief of the Franks, unified the country, accepted Christianity, and established the Merovingian dynasty. France was invaded by Muslim Saracens in the seventh century, but in 732 Charles Martel defeated the Saracens. His son, Pepin the Short, overthrew the last Merovingian ruler in 751 and proclaimed himself king. Pepin's son, Charlemagne, greatly expanded his kingdom and was crowned emperor of the West by the pope in 800. Ninth-century Viking invasions greatly weakened the power of the Carolingians and France broke up into estates, some of them effectively independent countries, ruled by great aristocrats. Among the most important were the duke- doms of Aquitaine and Burgundy and the counties of Flanders, Blois, and Anjou. In 911 the Vikings, who had repeatedly raided the Atlantic coast of France, established the duchy of Normandy. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty died out in France (although it survived in the Holy Roman Empire) and was replaced by a new line, the Capetians. Steadily expanding in both territory and power from their base in Paris, the Capetians solidified the foundations of the French monarchy. Paris became a great monastic and university city as well as a center of trade and manufacturing. Under the crusader-king Louis IX (St. Louis), France also became an international power. During the 14th century, the Black Death, peasant rebellions, and the beginning of the Hundred Years' War (1337&#x2013;1453) with England further weakened the French monarchy. The Norman conquest of England in 1066 had entwined the fortunes of the French and English monarchies, and with the Capetian line in decline, England pursued its claims in France. Henry V of England defeated the French at Agincourt in 1415, and in 1420 Charles IV made Henry heir to the throne of France. Henry's forces were defeated by French armies inspired by Joan of Arc, and in 1429 his claim to the French throne was overturned. In 1435 Burgundy allied itself with France, and in 1453 the English were driven out of France, except for an enclave at Calais. Louis XI completed the consolidation of France under the French monarchy. France prospered as a center of commerce, industry, agriculture, learning, and culture throughout the 16th century but was disrupted by religious civil wars stemming from the Reformation. The Protestant Henry of Navarre, heir to the throne, was obliged to accept Catholicism before being crowned in 1594; he became founder of the Bourbon monarchy. The consolidation of power under a highly centralized monarchy continued under Henry's heirs. With a foreign policy shaped by the powerful prime ministers Cardinal Richelieu and Cardinal Mazarin, France under Louis XIII and Louis XIV enhanced its stature in Europe by defeating the Habsburgs in the Thirty Years' War (1618&#x2013;48). Louis XIV&#x2014;the Sun King&#x2014;moved the court from Paris to his new palace at Versailles and presided over the wealthiest and most powerful monarchy in Europe. His persecution of the Huguenots resulted in a great emigration of Protestants from France. A grand alliance of European states thwarted France's expansionist aims on the continent, but France became a major colonial power in North America, controlling Canada and Louisiana (including most of the Mississippi-Missouri valley), and pursued overseas ventures in Africa and Asia as well. In the mid-18th century, France was weakened internationally by the expensive and fruitless Wars of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War. Under the Treaty of Paris (1763), France ceded control of Canada to Great Britain. The Enlightenment made France a world center of intellectual activity but also led to the questioning of the political and social bases of the French monarchy. An increasingly wealthy but powerless bourgeoisie chafed under the restrictions of an archaic socioeconomic order. France under Louis XVI supported the American colonies in the Revolutionary War, incurring a large public debt in the process. Combined with unrestrained extravagance on the part of the court and the aristocracy, poverty increased among the rural peasantry and the urban working class, while the bourgeoisie demanded a greater voice in government. These trends came to a head with the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789; soon thereafter, the Estates-General took control of the country, and France was in the throes of revolution. Revolutionary leaders at first allowed Louis XVI to remain on the throne in a limited monarchy, but the king and Marie Antoinette were subsequently tried for treason and executed in 1793. Thousands died during the Reign of Terror which continued until July 1794, ending with the execution of its primary architects, Augustin Robespierre and Georges Danton. The Directory, with five heads of each division of government (1795&#x2013;99), failed to maintain public order and suffered military reverses in foreign wars in which successive revolutionary governments had been embroiled since 1792. On Nov. 9, 1799, the Directory was overthrown by the Consulate, with Napoleon Bonaparte named first consul. Napoleon proclaimed himself emperor of France in 1804. He transformed French law through the Code Napoleon and initially expanded the French empire in Europe and the Middle East. Suffering repeated reverses against British naval forces and disastrous losses in his 1812 invasion of Russia, Napoleon was defeated by the British under Wellington at Waterloo in 1815, and the French empire collapsed. France restored its monarchy in 1815 but not its monarchical absolutism. Charles X, successor to Louis XVIII, was ousted in a coup d'&#xE9;tat in 1830 and replaced by the liberal Louis Philippe. The monarchy came to an end in the wave of popular revolt that swept France, along with most of Europe, in 1848; Louis Napoleon (nephew of Bonaparte) became president of the Second Republic. In 1852 he created the Second Empire, ruling as Napoleon III and presiding over a court that set the standards of fashion for the wealthy bourgeois society of 19th-century Europe. During the 19th century, France again became a major colonial power, acquiring important possessions in North and West Africa and Indochina. It also became a world leader in art, science, and literature and began its slow transformation into a major industrial power. Politically, however, France suffered from endemic weakness. The Second Empire ended disastrously with defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870&#x2013;71; the Paris Commune, formed during that war, was overthrown with great bloodshed. The Third Republic (1871&#x2013;1914), despite the glittering pleasures of the Belle Epoque and France's prestige as a world power, was shaken by the Dreyfus Affair of 1894&#x2013;1906. France joined with Great Britain and Russia in forming the Triple Entente of 1907, a defensive agreement against the Triple Alliance of Germany, Italy, and the Austro-Hungarian empire. During World War I&#x2014;in effect a war between these two alliances&#x2014;France suffered millions of casualties and severe damage in the north. Although its role as a leader of the victorious alliance was confirmed at the Versailles Conference of 1919, France was seriously weakened by the war and played a diminished role as a world power. France suffered badly in the world depression of the 1930's and could muster neither political nor military energy to offer effective opposition to the rise of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. France was a participant in the Munich Agreement of 1938, which sealed the fate of central Europe. When World War II broke out in 1939, Hitler initially held off his attack on France, but when it came in May-June 1940, France was swiftly and ignominiously defeated. During World War II, northern France was under German occupation, while in the south a collaborationist, semifascistic state was organized, with its capital at Vichy. Meanwhile, in London, Gen. Charles de Gaulle rallied the Free French forces, which fought on the Allied side in various campaigns. After the liberation of Paris a &#x201C;provisional government&#x201D; of various Resistance groups combined with de Gaulle's supporters drew up a constitution for the Fourth French Republic. Although it suffered from inherent political weaknesses and often failed to provide stable cabinets, the Fourth Republic presided over postwar recovery, aided by the Marshall Plan; it promoted a mixed socialist-free enterprise economy and instituted social reforms such as women's suffrage and social security. It also led the way toward a united Europe, playing a leading role in the organization of the EEC in 1957. France became a founding member of NATO in 1949. The Fourth Republic was unable, however, to withstand the strains of the dismantling of France's empire during the postwar wave of decolonization. France's recovery of Indochina in 1945 set off a war of national liberation there that lasted until France withdrew from the colony in 1954. Morocco and Tunisia won their independence in 1956; in Algeria, regarded as part of France itself, France fought on against Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN) rebels. The Algerian War seriously polarized French public opinion, and, threatened with an army coup, the National Assembly voted in 1958 to grant Pres. Charles de Gaulle emergency powers for six months. De Gaulle outmaneuvered his army backers and negotiated to turn Algeria over to the FLN, a process completed in 1962. Meanwhile he also restored order at home and presided over the drafting of a new constitution that created the Fifth Republic in 1958. The new constitution created a strong presidency, with powers to name the premier and the Council of Ministers and to preside over their meetings. The legislature was required to give priority to government initiatives and lacked authority over national defense, education, labor, and local government.

De Gaulle followed an independent foreign policy, pursuing European integration as well as closer relations with the Communist bloc and the Third World.

In ancient times various cultures flourished in the Arabian peninsula, particularly along the western rim, in cities devoted to trade between the Gulf of Aden and the eastern Mediterranean, and in such agricultural and trading centers as Yemen and Oman. Cultural and political unity was lacking, however, until the rise of Mohammed, the prophet of Islam. In A.D. 622 Mohammed fled from Mecca, the center of Arabian paganism, to the nearby city of Medina; the Islamic era dates from that year. Preaching from Medina, Mohammed gained converts to Islam throughout Arabia. His army captured Mecca in 630, converting its sacred shrine, the Kaaba, to an Islamic place of worship. By 632, when Mohammed died, all of Arabia was unified under Islamic rule. In 661 the Caliphate, the ruling body of early Islam, moved from Medina to Damascus. Thereafter Arabia was nominally unified under Islamic rule—but in practice was usually divided among various principalities in the arable areas and trading centers, and under tribal rule in the arid interior. Mecca fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1517, but Ottoman control of Arabia was never complete. The rise of the Wahabi sect of Islam in the 18th century posed a challenge to Ottoman rule. In the 19th century, the Saud family rose to leadership in the Wahabi movement and established a kingdom in Nejd, the central region of Arabia, with a capital at Riyadh. In 1902 Ibn Saud (1880–1953) consolidated his family's control at Riyadh and in 1912–13 led a new Wahabi revolt against the Ottoman Turks. During World War I, the British aided Ibn Saud's rebellion in the Nejd, along with that of Ibn Saud's rival Hussein ibn Ali in the Hejaz, in the mountains of western Arabia along the coast of the Red Sea. A British protectorate was established in both regions in 1915, and Great Britain maintained a dominant position in Arabia after World War I. In 1924 Ibn Saud captured Hussein ibn Ali's capital at Mecca, and he proclaimed himself king of Hejaz in 1926 and of Nejd in 1927. Ibn Saud consolidated his control over the following two years, and his kingdom was formally recognized by Great Britain in 1927. The country was renamed Saudi Arabia in 1932. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy based on Islamic law; it has no written constitution and no parliament. The king exercises sole authority and rules in consultation with a Council of Ministers. Islamic law is enforced; alcohol is prohibited and the public activities of women severely restricted. The Saudi kings have great power within the Islamic world through their control over the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and their administration of the annual Muslim pilgrimages to those cities. The discovery of oil in eastern Arabia in the early 1930's rapidly transformed Saudi Arabia from an impoverished nation to a center of great wealth. In 1933 an exclusive concession for the exploitation of Saudi Arabian oil was granted to an American-chartered corporation, the Arabian-American Oil Company (Aramco). For many years wealth remained concentrated in the hands of the Saudi clan, and little change was felt in the desert interior, where Bedouin nomads continued to raise sheep and camels. Large numbers of Yemenis, Palestinians, Pakistanis, and other foreign workers are employed in the oil fields. Saudi Arabia remained neutral during most of World War II but declared war on the Axis powers in March 1945; in the same year, it became a founding member of both the United Nations and the Arab League. Ibn Saud became a leader of Arab anti-Zionism and contributed a small contingent of troops to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. That policy was maintained by Ibn Saud's second son and successor, King Faisal, who instituted a policy of providing large annual subsidies to Egypt and other Arab League states following the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. In 1973 King Faisal sent Saudi units to fight in the Arab-Israeli War of that year. He played a leading role in organizing the 1973–74 Arab oil embargo in an effort to force the United States and its allies to take a harder line with Israel. King Faisal was assassinated by his nephew, Prince Faisal, on Mar. 25, 1975, and was succeeded by King Khalid. Little change in policy resulted. In 1979 Saudi Arabia denounced the Camp David talks and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and led the Arab League effort to ostracize Egypt within the Arab world. Saudi Arabia has consistently opposed leftist and radical movements in the Arab world, sending troops to help put down leftist rebellions in North Yemen and Oman in the 1970's. Saudi kings have taken a moderate approach toward relations with the West. Following the transfer of Aramco assets to full Saudi Arabian ownership during 1973–76, Saudi Arabia used its leading position within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to argue for a policy of stable production and prices. This moderate policy has been rewarded by the willingness of the U.S., Great Britain, France, and other Western nations to sell arms—including jet fighters, tanks, and other sophisticated weapons—to Saudi Arabia despite Israeli protests. The multibillion-dollar arms trade has helped to offset the Western oil trade deficit with Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia experienced repeated disturbances in the 1980's. Muslim fundamentalist terrorists seized the Grand Mosque at Mecca on Nov. 20, 1979, provoking a crisis for the Saudi monarchy. On July 31, 1987, Iranian pilgrims rioted in Mecca and were fired upon by Saudi security forces; 402 persons died, including 275 Iranians. Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini denounced the Saudi government and said it was unworthy of being the guardian of Islam's sacred shrines. A longtime supporter of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Saudi government gave the PLO $850 million during the 1980's, but ceased when the PLO backed Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. During the Persian Gulf War, King Fahd granted permission to station U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia to guard against a possible Iraqi attack. The Saudis promised the United States $16.8 billion and Egypt $1.5 billion to defray the costs of the war. Little ground fighting took place on Saudi soil, but massive oil spills threatened the operation of crucial desalination plants in the Persian Gulf. Since the war, Saudi Arabia has played a prominent and pivotal role in the diplomatic efforts of the United States and its allies to reach a permanent accord in the Middle East. In 1996 King Fahd, ailing from a 1995 stroke, temporarily ceded power to his legal successor, Crown Prince Abdullah. In June, terrorists bombed an apartment complex in Dhahran, killing 19 American soldiers stationed there and wounding more than 300 people. U.S.-Saudi relations were greatly strained when the 9/11 attacks were revealed to have been perpetrated by Saudi citizens. In May 2003 terrorist attacks in the form of four suicide bombings occurred in Riyad in two days. In Aug. a U.S. Congressional report on the 9/11 attacks appeared with 28 of its 850 pages deleted by the White House, pages reportedly describing support provided by Saudi government officials to the hijacker-terrorists.","https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/saudi-arabia.html","GEOGRAPHY Location: occupies four-fifths of Arabian peninsula in southwestern Asia.

In ancient times various cultures flourished in the Arabian peninsula, particularly along the western rim, in cities devoted to trade between the Gulf of Aden and the eastern Mediterranean, and in such agricultural and trading centers as Yemen and Oman. Cultural and political unity was lacking, however, until the rise of Mohammed, the prophet of Islam. In A.D. 622 Mohammed fled from Mecca, the center of Arabian paganism, to the nearby city of Medina; the Islamic era dates from that year. Preaching from Medina, Mohammed gained converts to Islam throughout Arabia. His army captured Mecca in 630, converting its sacred shrine, the Kaaba, to an Islamic place of worship. By 632, when Mohammed died, all of Arabia was unified under Islamic rule. In 661 the Caliphate, the ruling body of early Islam, moved from Medina to Damascus. Thereafter Arabia was nominally unified under Islamic rule&#x2014;but in practice was usually divided among various principalities in the arable areas and trading centers, and under tribal rule in the arid interior. Mecca fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1517, but Ottoman control of Arabia was never complete. The rise of the Wahabi sect of Islam in the 18th century posed a challenge to Ottoman rule. In the 19th century, the Saud family rose to leadership in the Wahabi movement and established a kingdom in Nejd, the central region of Arabia, with a capital at Riyadh. In 1902 Ibn Saud (1880&#x2013;1953) consolidated his family's control at Riyadh and in 1912&#x2013;13 led a new Wahabi revolt against the Ottoman Turks. During World War I, the British aided Ibn Saud's rebellion in the Nejd, along with that of Ibn Saud's rival Hussein ibn Ali in the Hejaz, in the mountains of western Arabia along the coast of the Red Sea. A British protectorate was established in both regions in 1915, and Great Britain maintained a dominant position in Arabia after World War I. In 1924 Ibn Saud captured Hussein ibn Ali's capital at Mecca, and he proclaimed himself king of Hejaz in 1926 and of Nejd in 1927. Ibn Saud consolidated his control over the following two years, and his kingdom was formally recognized by Great Britain in 1927. The country was renamed Saudi Arabia in 1932. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy based on Islamic law; it has no written constitution and no parliament. The king exercises sole authority and rules in consultation with a Council of Ministers. Islamic law is enforced; alcohol is prohibited and the public activities of women severely restricted. The Saudi kings have great power within the Islamic world through their control over the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and their administration of the annual Muslim pilgrimages to those cities. The discovery of oil in eastern Arabia in the early 1930's rapidly transformed Saudi Arabia from an impoverished nation to a center of great wealth. In 1933 an exclusive concession for the exploitation of Saudi Arabian oil was granted to an American-chartered corporation, the Arabian-American Oil Company (Aramco). For many years wealth remained concentrated in the hands of the Saudi clan, and little change was felt in the desert interior, where Bedouin nomads continued to raise sheep and camels. Large numbers of Yemenis, Palestinians, Pakistanis, and other foreign workers are employed in the oil fields. Saudi Arabia remained neutral during most of World War II but declared war on the Axis powers in March 1945; in the same year, it became a founding member of both the United Nations and the Arab League. Ibn Saud became a leader of Arab anti-Zionism and contributed a small contingent of troops to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. That policy was maintained by Ibn Saud's second son and successor, King Faisal, who instituted a policy of providing large annual subsidies to Egypt and other Arab League states following the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. In 1973 King Faisal sent Saudi units to fight in the Arab-Israeli War of that year. He played a leading role in organizing the 1973&#x2013;74 Arab oil embargo in an effort to force the United States and its allies to take a harder line with Israel. King Faisal was assassinated by his nephew, Prince Faisal, on Mar. 25, 1975, and was succeeded by King Khalid. Little change in policy resulted.

(13% Germany, 9% France, 7% Netherlands, 5% Benelux), 13% U.S. Early megalithic and Iron Age peoples of Britain, primarily Celtic, developed tribal states that were conquered by Roman invaders in A.D. 43. After Roman legions withdrew from Britain in 410, invasions of Jutes, Angles, and Saxons conquered much of England, while Celtic peoples flourished in Wales, Scotland, and especially Ireland. Viking invaders established settlements in the eighth century. A united Saxon kingdom fell to the Norman invasion of William the Conquerer in 1066. An aristocratic rebellion against the royal absolutism of King John in 1215 led to the royal acceptance of the Magna Carta, guaranteeing legal rights and laying the foundations of parliamentary government. From the 12th to the 15th century, the Plantagenet dynasty ruled England and claimed overlordship over Ireland; Wales was conquered in 1283. The Plantagenets also controlled sizable territories in France. The Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) cost England its French possessions; the War of the Roses, (1455–85) ended the Plantagenet dynasty and brought Henry Tudor (Henry VII) to the throne. The Tudors gradually centralized royal control by bringing pressure against both the church and the nobility. Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534 and established the Church of England. Under Elizabeth I, the last of the Tudors, England defeated Spain at sea and laid the foundations of later worldwide English sea power. The English Renaissance began under Elizabeth I (1533–1603) with the works of Shakespeare and continued into the 17th century with Milton and Newton. The Stuart dynasty was founded by James I (1566–1625), uniting the crowns of England and Scotland in 1603. The English Civil War (1642–49) culminated in the execution of Charles I and the proclamation of the Commonwealth (later the Protectorate) under Oliver Cromwell. The monarchy was restored with Charles II in 1660. In the bloodless Glorious Revolution (1688), James II fled before a Protestant army under the Dutch William of Orange, who married and ruled jointly with James's daughter Mary II. The English Bill of Rights established the supremacy of Parliament and made the government a model of constitutional monarchy. In the last gasp of the Stuart claimants to the throne, Irish supporters of James II were defeated at the Battle of the Boyne (1690), which temporarily crushed Irish resistance to annexation by England. The United Kingdom was created when Scotland was joined with England in a common Parliament by the Act of Union in 1707. A Scottish uprising led by the Young Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart, was crushed at Culloden Moor in 1745. Ireland was made part of the United Kingdom in 1801. In the 1700's the United Kingdom became the greatest sea power in the world, controlling an empire that included much of North America and India. Agrarian “enclosures” of the 18th century ruined the peasantry but created an entrepreneurial revolution in agriculture that ultimately led to greatly increased agricultural productivity. The capital created in the process contributed to the success of the Industrial Revolution, which over the next century made England the wealthiest land on earth. Despite the loss of the 13 colonies after the American Revolution (1775–83), England consolidated its holdings in the Indian subcontinent, Australia and New Zealand, Malaya, Hong Kong, much of eastern Africa from “Cape to Cairo,” and elsewhere. Britain's prosperity and moral purpose were embodied in the person of Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland (1836–1901) and Empress of India (from 1836). The repeal of the protectionist Corn Laws in 1846 led to an agricultural depression and hastened the migration of labor from the countryside to the industrial cities. The rise of labor activism led in 1906 to laws granting privileged status to trade unions, which organized the Labour party to promote their interests. Britain's involvement in the Triple Entente with France and Russia ensured its participation in World War I (1914–18) against Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary. Victory came at the cost of an entire generation of British youth, but Britain emerged from the war with its empire at a high point, adding Tanganyika, Jordan, Palestine, and Iraq as part of the postwar division of spoils. Most of Ireland became independent in 1921, however, leaving only Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. Between the two world wars, Britain's navy and air force were the largest in the world, its army the third largest. Yet its industry was aging, the Great Depression hit especially hard in the British Isles, strikes and labor unrest weakened the social fabric, and colonial ties began to weaken in the 1930's. Economic retrenchment led to a failure to rearm in the face of the rising threat of Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. The Munich Pact of 1938 gave Hitler a license for war; his invasion of Poland in 1939 forced Britain into the conflict. When Winston Churchill became prime minister in 1940, Britain was under daily air attack and in danger of an invasion by sea, and the country was dependent on American friendship and lend-lease war materials. But 1941 brought alliance with the United States and the Soviet Union, and a slowly turning tide of war leading to victory in 1945. Still, postwar Britain dropped to the second rank of superpowers. The coalition between the Conservative and Labour parties that had governed Great Britain during the war seemed no longer necessary in 1945 as the war wound down. Labour won a landslide victory in the 1945 elections; Churchill was recalled in the midst of the Potsdam Conference, and Clement Atlee became prime minister. A brief Labour flirtation with the U.S.S.R. quickly ended in the postwar 1940's; England became a founding member of the United Nations and also, in 1949, of NATO. As the Cold War took shape, Britain developed its own nuclear arsenal. The Labour party nationalized the Bank of England along with railroads, public utilities, and heavy industry. A comprehensive welfare state apparatus was created, including a national health service, unemployment and retirement benefits, and free education at all levels. But Britain was in many respects too poor to afford such changes; in order to cut expenditures, the government hastened the process of withdrawal from colonies and military bases around the world. India was granted independence in 1947, and Palestine, Burma, and Ceylon in 1948–49. The elections of 1951 brought Churchill back to the prime ministership at the head of a Conservative majority that would last for 13 years. The Conservatives returned steel and trucking to the private sector but in general refrained from undoing the social policies of their Labour predecessors. Economic growth began in the 1950's and held steady at about 2.5 percent per year, a significantly lower rate than in continental Europe; obsolescence, excessive wage and benefit settlements, and a low savings rate all took their toll. The coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 added a much-needed element of national celebration. Churchill retired in 1955 and was succeeded by Anthony Eden. Eden's government fell in 1956 over the failed Anglo-French invasion of Suez. Eden's fall in 1957 brought to power Harold Macmillan, who pursued close relations with the United States. Most important, he presided over the transformation of an empire to a commonwealth; in the early 1960's, Ghana, Nigeria, Malaya, Singapore, and numerous other colonies were granted independence and Commonwealth status. Immigrants from the Commonwealth promptly flocked to England, straining housing, social services, and the labor market and creating problems of assimilation that remain unsolved. Britain under Macmillan was the moving force behind the European Free Trade Association in 1960. In 1961 Britain applied for membership in the EEC, but that application was humiliatingly vetoed by France's Charles de Gaulle in 1963. Macmillan's government fell with the Profumo Scandal of 1963, and Douglas Home became a caretaker prime minister pending new elections. The 1964 elections brought the Labour party to power under Harold Wilson, whose moderate positions made him unpopular with his own party, especially when he sponsored legislation to ban wildcat strikes. Strikes, wage inflation, the steady growth of the public sector (including renationalization of the steel industry), and the rise of turmoil in Northern Ireland in 1968–69 combined to make public support for Labour evaporate. The Conservative victory in the 1970 elections brought Edward Heath to the office of prime minister. Promising to cut expenditures and taxes, reward initiative, and curb union power, the Conservatives were able to accomplish none of those aims. Heath's government imposed ineffective wage controls in an attempt to slow inflation and passed the 1971 Industrial Relations Act to regulate unions. When unions defied that act, the government fell. Heath's major achievement was the United Kingdom's admission to the EC in 1973. Continued turmoil in Northern Ireland was met with the abolition of Ulster's Stormount Parliament in 1972 and the imposition of direct British rule—a policy that did nothing to stem the growing sectarian violence. Wilson returned to the prime ministership in 1974 and retired in 1976, passing on the office to James Callaghan, who governed until 1979 at the head of a Labour-Liberal coalition. The continued power of trade unions was seen in the repeal of the Industrial Relations Act and the extension of union privileges. The left wing of the Labour party brought increasing pressure against defense spending, membership in NATO, and also loudly criticized American involvement in Vietnam. The OPEC oil price rises of 1972–74 hurt Great Britain in the short run but also encouraged development of oil and gas fields in the North Sea, which made the nation a major petroleum exporter and helped revitalize its economy. Oil exploration in the North Sea also encouraged Scottish nationalism, with some damage to national unity, although in both Scotland and Wales, proposals in 1979 for separate parliaments were soundly defeated by plebiscites. The 1979 elections brought the Conservatives to power again, behind Margaret Thatcher, Great Britain's (and Europe's) first female prime minister. She proved to be the only British prime minister in modern times to lead her party successfully in three elections. Thatcher took office with an agenda that involved undoing much of the course of postwar British history. The first target was inflation, attacked through a freeze on expenditures and reduction of government borrowing. The policy was a success; inflation fell from 18 percent in 1980 to 3 percent in 1989. But the austerity program had a high cost in unemployment, which remained at 14 percent in the mid-1980's. In 1982 national attention turned abruptly to overseas concerns, as Argentina invaded the Falkland (“Malvinas”) Islands (only 300 miles east of Argentina), which it had long claimed as Argentine national territory, on Apr. 2. On May 21 British forces launched a counteroffensive, and the invading Argentine forces surrendered on June 14. The nation's success in mounting an amphibious operation 6,500 miles away provoked an upsurge of patriotism that swept Thatcher's party into a second term in 1983. After the election the government turned to denationalization of industry. Over $30 billion in state property—from industrial giants, such as Britoil and British Gas, to individual apartments in municipal housing projects—was sold to private interests. This program was followed in 1986 by tax cuts, in which the top income-tax rate dropped from 98 percent to 40 percent. In foreign affairs, Britain agreed in 1985 to return Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The 1987 elections pitted the Conservatives against a weak Labour party that opposed NATO missile deployment in Great Britain, advocating unilateral disarmament and calling for renationalization of industry and a return to higher taxes for the wealthy. The Conservatives easily won their third straight election. By 1989 the “Thatcher Revolution” had produced a decisive long-term economic recovery, but one that was unevenly distributed: the southern part of the country enjoyed an economic boom, while the older industrial cities of the north remained stagnant. In 1990 an economic slowdown and rising inflation led to a strong decline in support for Mrs. Thatcher and her government. She resigned in November 1990. Thatcher was replaced by Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, whose greatest challenge has been Britain's role in a united Europe, to which Britain now has a land link via the 31-mile Channel Tunnel (Chunnel), completed in 1994. In the April 1992 elections, the Conservatives, led by Major, won a comfortable 21-seat margin in Parliament despite a recession. Not since the Napoleonic Wars has a British political party been able to form four consecutive governments. Yet only 13 months later Major's ratings in the polls had fallen to 21 percent as the economy stalled and the Conservatives themselves split badly over some elements in the E.C.'s Maastricht Treaty. The Conservatives were further beset in 1994 with a series of tabloid scandals and allegations of political corruption concerning arms sales to Iraq and Malaysia. Conservative chances in parliamentary elections, due in the spring of 1997, were looking very slim, and they looked worse in March after the government clumsily handled the news that scientists had concluded that eating English beef could cause the fatal “mad-cow” disease. After insisting that there was no cause for alarm the government was forced to deal with an E.U. boycott. The parliamentary election of May 1997 ended 18 years of Tory government with Labour winning its largest majority since 1935, 419 seats to the Conservatives 165. The new Prime Minister Tony Blair appointed a cabinet of political moderates. In 1997 Hong Kong was returned to China without incident and in April 1998 the Blair government succeeded in negotiating a settlement in Northern Ireland although problems still remain. In May 1999 the first elections to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly were held. Labour won a plurality in both (over nationalist parties). The two bodies have authority over education, environment, health care, housing, and law enforcement. The Scottish Parliament also possesses authority to tax. In the 2001 elections Blair's Labour Party won a huge victory, taking 413 of 659 seats, the first time Labour had won two consecutive victories. Still, in local elections in May 2002 and 2003, the Conservatives trounced labor. The vote on invading Iraq carried overwhelmingly (412–143); yet in the aftermath of victory serious troubles arose for the Blair government over the intelligence accounts used to justify British participation.","https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/great-britain.html","GEOGRAPHY Location: northwestern Europe, occupying major portion of British Isles.

After Roman legions withdrew from Britain in 410, invasions of Jutes, Angles, and Saxons conquered much of England, while Celtic peoples flourished in Wales, Scotland, and especially Ireland. Viking invaders established settlements in the eighth century. A united Saxon kingdom fell to the Norman invasion of William the Conquerer in 1066. An aristocratic rebellion against the royal absolutism of King John in 1215 led to the royal acceptance of the Magna Carta, guaranteeing legal rights and laying the foundations of parliamentary government. From the 12th to the 15th century, the Plantagenet dynasty ruled England and claimed overlordship over Ireland; Wales was conquered in 1283. The Plantagenets also controlled sizable territories in France. The Hundred Years' War (1337&#x2013;1453) cost England its French possessions; the War of the Roses, (1455&#x2013;85) ended the Plantagenet dynasty and brought Henry Tudor (Henry VII) to the throne. The Tudors gradually centralized royal control by bringing pressure against both the church and the nobility. Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534 and established the Church of England. Under Elizabeth I, the last of the Tudors, England defeated Spain at sea and laid the foundations of later worldwide English sea power. The English Renaissance began under Elizabeth I (1533&#x2013;1603) with the works of Shakespeare and continued into the 17th century with Milton and Newton. The Stuart dynasty was founded by James I (1566&#x2013;1625), uniting the crowns of England and Scotland in 1603. The English Civil War (1642&#x2013;49) culminated in the execution of Charles I and the proclamation of the Commonwealth (later the Protectorate) under Oliver Cromwell. The monarchy was restored with Charles II in 1660. In the bloodless Glorious Revolution (1688), James II fled before a Protestant army under the Dutch William of Orange, who married and ruled jointly with James's daughter Mary II. The English Bill of Rights established the supremacy of Parliament and made the government a model of constitutional monarchy. In the last gasp of the Stuart claimants to the throne, Irish supporters of James II were defeated at the Battle of the Boyne (1690), which temporarily crushed Irish resistance to annexation by England. The United Kingdom was created when Scotland was joined with England in a common Parliament by the Act of Union in 1707. A Scottish uprising led by the Young Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart, was crushed at Culloden Moor in 1745. Ireland was made part of the United Kingdom in 1801. In the 1700's the United Kingdom became the greatest sea power in the world, controlling an empire that included much of North America and India. Agrarian &#x201C;enclosures&#x201D; of the 18th century ruined the peasantry but created an entrepreneurial revolution in agriculture that ultimately led to greatly increased agricultural productivity. The capital created in the process contributed to the success of the Industrial Revolution, which over the next century made England the wealthiest land on earth. Despite the loss of the 13 colonies after the American Revolution (1775&#x2013;83), England consolidated its holdings in the Indian subcontinent, Australia and New Zealand, Malaya, Hong Kong, much of eastern Africa from &#x201C;Cape to Cairo,&#x201D; and elsewhere. Britain's prosperity and moral purpose were embodied in the person of Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland (1836&#x2013;1901) and Empress of India (from 1836). The repeal of the protectionist Corn Laws in 1846 led to an agricultural depression and hastened the migration of labor from the countryside to the industrial cities. The rise of labor activism led in 1906 to laws granting privileged status to trade unions, which organized the Labour party to promote their interests. Britain's involvement in the Triple Entente with France and Russia ensured its participation in World War I (1914&#x2013;18) against Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary. Victory came at the cost of an entire generation of British youth, but Britain emerged from the war with its empire at a high point, adding Tanganyika, Jordan, Palestine, and Iraq as part of the postwar division of spoils. Most of Ireland became independent in 1921, however, leaving only Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. Between the two world wars, Britain's navy and air force were the largest in the world, its army the third largest. Yet its industry was aging, the Great Depression hit especially hard in the British Isles, strikes and labor unrest weakened the social fabric, and colonial ties began to weaken in the 1930's. Economic retrenchment led to a failure to rearm in the face of the rising threat of Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. The Munich Pact of 1938 gave Hitler a license for war; his invasion of Poland in 1939 forced Britain into the conflict. When Winston Churchill became prime minister in 1940, Britain was under daily air attack and in danger of an invasion by sea, and the country was dependent on American friendship and lend-lease war materials. But 1941 brought alliance with the United States and the Soviet Union, and a slowly turning tide of war leading to victory in 1945. Still, postwar Britain dropped to the second rank of superpowers. The coalition between the Conservative and Labour parties that had governed Great Britain during the war seemed no longer necessary in 1945 as the war wound down. Labour won a landslide victory in the 1945 elections; Churchill was recalled in the midst of the Potsdam Conference, and Clement Atlee became prime minister. A brief Labour flirtation with the U.S.S.R. quickly ended in the postwar 1940's; England became a founding member of the United Nations and also, in 1949, of NATO. As the Cold War took shape, Britain developed its own nuclear arsenal. The Labour party nationalized the Bank of England along with railroads, public utilities, and heavy industry. A comprehensive welfare state apparatus was created, including a national health service, unemployment and retirement benefits, and free education at all levels. But Britain was in many respects too poor to afford such changes; in order to cut expenditures, the government hastened the process of withdrawal from colonies and military bases around the world. India was granted independence in 1947, and Palestine, Burma, and Ceylon in 1948&#x2013;49. The elections of 1951 brought Churchill back to the prime ministership at the head of a Conservative majority that would last for 13 years. The Conservatives returned steel and trucking to the private sector but in general refrained from undoing the social policies of their Labour predecessors. Economic growth began in the 1950's and held steady at about 2.5 percent per year, a significantly lower rate than in continental Europe; obsolescence, excessive wage and benefit settlements, and a low savings rate all took their toll. The coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 added a much-needed element of national celebration. Churchill retired in 1955 and was succeeded by Anthony Eden. Eden's government fell in 1956 over the failed Anglo-French invasion of Suez. Eden's fall in 1957 brought to power Harold Macmillan, who pursued close relations with the United States. Most important, he presided over the transformation of an empire to a commonwealth; in the early 1960's, Ghana, Nigeria, Malaya, Singapore, and numerous other colonies were granted independence and Commonwealth status. Immigrants from the Commonwealth promptly flocked to England, straining housing, social services, and the labor market and creating problems of assimilation that remain unsolved. Britain under Macmillan was the moving force behind the European Free Trade Association in 1960. In 1961 Britain applied for membership in the EEC, but that application was humiliatingly vetoed by France's Charles de Gaulle in 1963. Macmillan's government fell with the Profumo Scandal of 1963, and Douglas Home became a caretaker prime minister pending new elections. The 1964 elections brought the Labour party to power under Harold Wilson, whose moderate positions made him unpopular with his own party, especially when he sponsored legislation to ban wildcat strikes. Strikes, wage inflation, the steady growth of the public sector (including renationalization of the steel industry), and the rise of turmoil in Northern Ireland in 1968&#x2013;69 combined to make public support for Labour evaporate. The Conservative victory in the 1970 elections brought Edward Heath to the office of prime minister. Promising to cut expenditures and taxes, reward initiative, and curb union power, the Conservatives were able to accomplish none of those aims. Heath's government imposed ineffective wage controls in an attempt to slow inflation and passed the 1971 Industrial Relations Act to regulate unions. When unions defied that act, the government fell. Heath's major achievement was the United Kingdom's admission to the EC in 1973. Continued turmoil in Northern Ireland was met with the abolition of Ulster's Stormount Parliament in 1972 and the imposition of direct British rule&#x2014;a policy that did nothing to stem the growing sectarian violence. Wilson returned to the prime ministership in 1974 and retired in 1976, passing on the office to James Callaghan, who governed until 1979 at the head of a Labour-Liberal coalition. The continued power of trade unions was seen in the repeal of the Industrial Relations Act and the extension of union privileges. The left wing of the Labour party brought increasing pressure against defense spending, membership in NATO, and also loudly criticized American involvement in Vietnam. The OPEC oil price rises of 1972&#x2013;74 hurt Great Britain in the short run but also encouraged development of oil and gas fields in the North Sea, which made the nation a major petroleum exporter and helped revitalize its economy. Oil exploration in the North Sea also encouraged Scottish nationalism, with some damage to national unity, although in both Scotland and Wales, proposals in 1979 for separate parliaments were soundly defeated by plebiscites. The 1979 elections brought the Conservatives to power again, behind Margaret Thatcher, Great Britain's (and Europe's) first female prime minister. She proved to be the only British prime minister in modern times to lead her party successfully in three elections. Thatcher took office with an agenda that involved undoing much of the course of postwar British history. The first target was inflation, attacked through a freeze on expenditures and reduction of government borrowing. The policy was a success; inflation fell from 18 percent in 1980 to 3 percent in 1989. But the austerity program had a high cost in unemployment, which remained at 14 percent in the mid-1980's. In 1982 national attention turned abruptly to overseas concerns, as Argentina invaded the Falkland (&#x201C;Malvinas&#x201D;) Islands (only 300 miles east of Argentina), which it had long claimed as Argentine national territory, on Apr. 2. On May 21 British forces launched a counteroffensive, and the invading Argentine forces surrendered on June 14. The nation's success in mounting an amphibious operation 6,500 miles away provoked an upsurge of patriotism that swept Thatcher's party into a second term in 1983. After the election the government turned to denationalization of industry. Over $30 billion in state property&#x2014;from industrial giants, such as Britoil and British Gas, to individual apartments in municipal housing projects&#x2014;was sold to private interests. This program was followed in 1986 by tax cuts, in which the top income-tax rate dropped from 98 percent to 40 percent. In foreign affairs, Britain agreed in 1985 to return Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The 1987 elections pitted the Conservatives against a weak Labour party that opposed NATO missile deployment in Great Britain, advocating unilateral disarmament and calling for renationalization of industry and a return to higher taxes for the wealthy. The Conservatives easily won their third straight election. By 1989 the &#x201C;Thatcher Revolution&#x201D; had produced a decisive long-term economic recovery, but one that was unevenly distributed: the southern part of the country enjoyed an economic boom, while the older industrial cities of the north remained stagnant. In 1990 an economic slowdown and rising inflation led to a strong decline in support for Mrs. Thatcher and her government. She resigned in November 1990. Thatcher was replaced by Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, whose greatest challenge has been Britain's role in a united Europe, to which Britain now has a land link via the 31-mile Channel Tunnel (Chunnel), completed in 1994. In the April 1992 elections, the Conservatives, led by Major, won a comfortable 21-seat margin in Parliament despite a recession. Not since the Napoleonic Wars has a British political party been able to form four consecutive governments. Yet only 13 months later Major's ratings in the polls had fallen to 21 percent as the economy stalled and the Conservatives themselves split badly over some elements in the E.C.'s Maastricht Treaty. The Conservatives were further beset in 1994 with a series of tabloid scandals and allegations of political corruption concerning arms sales to Iraq and Malaysia. Conservative chances in parliamentary elections, due in the spring of 1997, were looking very slim, and they looked worse in March after the government clumsily handled the news that scientists had concluded that eating English beef could cause the fatal &#x201C;mad-cow&#x201D; disease. After insisting that there was no cause for alarm the government was forced to deal with an E.U. boycott. The parliamentary election of May 1997 ended 18 years of Tory government with Labour winning its largest majority since 1935, 419 seats to the Conservatives 165. The new Prime Minister Tony Blair appointed a cabinet of political moderates. In 1997 Hong Kong was returned to China without incident and in April 1998 the Blair government succeeded in negotiating a settlement in Northern Ireland although problems still remain. In May 1999 the first elections to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly were held. Labour won a plurality in both (over nationalist parties). The two bodies have authority over education, environment, health care, housing, and law enforcement. The Scottish Parliament also possesses authority to tax. In the 2001 elections Blair's Labour Party won a huge victory, taking 413 of 659 seats, the first time Labour had won two consecutive victories. Still, in local elections in May 2002 and 2003, the Conservatives trounced labor. The vote on invading Iraq carried overwhelmingly (412&#x2013;143); yet in the aftermath of victory serious troubles arose for the Blair government over the intelligence accounts used to justify British participation.

Its Mediterranean ports were frequented by Phoenician traders, and part of the country was incorporated into the empire of Carthage. Spain fell under the Roman Empire around 200 B.C.; Roman rule ended when the Visigoths invaded and took control of the Iberian Peninsula in the fifth century. The Visigoths adopted Christianity but were in turn conquered by Moors from northwest Africa in A.D. 711. The Berber/Arab civilization of the Moors produced the most elegant and cultivated culture in medieval Europe, and was an important conduit for the reintroduction of Greek science into Europe in the 12th century. The Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula began almost immediately after the Moors had established themselves and proceeded slowly but steadily over a period of 750 years. The consolidation of the region's small, contentious Christian kingdoms came with the marital alliance of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1469. Granada, the last Moorish outpost in Spain, fell to the forces of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492, just as Columbus, with Isabella's sponsorship, was discovering the lands that were to become Spain's New World empire. Under the Inquisition, begun in 1478, Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, and Muslims in 1502. Under the Habsburg dynasty (1516–1700), Spain reached the zenith of its power and prestige around the year 1600 (despite the 1588 defeat of the Spanish Armada by England), controlling an empire that embraced nearly all of South America (except Brazil), Central America, Mexico, western North America, the Philippines, and smaller territories in Africa and Asia. But Spain's loss of the Netherlands, endless struggles with the French in Europe and the Turks in the Mediterranean, and relentless inflation caused by imports of New World silver—all took their toll. During the 18th century, the Bourbons ruled a declining but still powerful Spain, until Napoleon installed his brother as king in 1808. After Napoleon's defeat, the Bourbons returned in 1814, but the loss of the South American colonies, three dynastic wars, and a brief republican interlude after 1868 were all signs of progressive weakness. The crowning blow to Spanish power and prestige was the loss of the Spanish-American War to the United States in 1898, leading to the independence of Cuba and the American takeover of Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Spain remained neutral in World War I. In 1923 Primo de Rivera established a dictatorship; he was forced out of office by King Alfonso XIII in 1930, but in 1931 the king was forced to abdicate. A republic replaced the monarchy. Its volatile mixture of socialism, anticlericalism, and decentralization provoked a right-wing reaction. The government moved to the Right, and in 1934 a miner's strike in Asturia was put down with great bloodshed. A left-wing government was elected in 1936 and deposed in a coup, which led to the terrible Civil War of 1936–39, in which Spain became a battleground for competing world ideologies. The Nationalists, aided by Hitler and Mussolini, defeated the Republicans, aided by Stalin and by leftist volunteers from many countries. Out of the wreckage emerged the dictatorship of the intensely patriotic and Catholic general Francisco Franco. At the time of the Civil War, Spain was still an agricultural country, with small holdings in the north and great estates in the south. In the Basque country, the mining of iron, copper, and lead provided both exports and a domestic iron and steel industry, which had been the case since the 19th century. In the 20th century, shipbuilding and chemicals were added to the traditional textile industries of the Mediterranean coastal cities. The war largely destroyed this industrial base, which was not rebuilt until the 1950's. Except for a contingent of troops sent to fight with the German invaders of the Soviet Union, Spain remained precariously neutral during World War II; Franco declined to repay Hitler for his support in the Civil War. But wartime Spain, despite its neutrality, could not muster the resources to undertake national reconstruction. In postwar Europe, the Franco regime seemed like a remnant of the fascism of the 1930's; Stalin's active hostility led the United Nations to treat Spain as an international pariah. At home Franco represented peace and stability; few Spaniards were willing to risk a return to civil strife by opposing him. Over time the military and Catholic aspects of the regime grew more pronounced, while fascist elements were downplayed. In 1947 the Law of Succession made Spain a monarchy without a king, awaiting the restoration of the throne in the post-Franco era. The Cold War led to friendlier American relations with Spain and the establishment of American military bases in 1953. U.N. membership followed in 1955. Despite some resultant growth in international trade, Spain's economy lagged, with industrialization barely beginning. In 1958 Franco turned the direction of the economy over to a group of technocrats, mostly neoliberal members of the Opus Dei lay Catholic order. With U.S. economic and military aid, a growing tourist industry, increased foreign investment, and, especially, freer markets, the economy revived. Older industries like iron, steel, and textiles were rejuvenated, while newer ones, such as chemicals, plastics, automobile assembly, and power plants, were created. Agriculture was increasingly mechanized, and it shifted to export-oriented ranching and horticulture. In 1967 Franco proclaimed the Organic Law, which, while confirming him as head of state, granted some independence to the Cortes (legislature) and permitted heads of families to vote for some of its delegates. This, along with a relaxation of censorship, softened the growing opposition to the regime among students, labor unions, and regional separatists. In 1969 Prince Juan Carlos was named heir apparent to the Spanish throne. Franco died in 1975 and was duly succeeded by Juan Carlos. With the new prime minister, Adolfo Suarez, the king worked to liberalize the Franco inheritance: Political parties were legalized; the Cortes was transformed into a bicameral legislature, with both houses elected by universal suffrage; the first elections since 1936 were held; and a new constitution was promulgated—all by 1978. In 1980, Catalonia and the Basque country were granted home rule, following overwhelming plebiscite victories. In the Basque lands, however, violent terrorist agitation for complete independence continues to this day. Under the new monarchy, Spain became a full participant in the affairs of Europe. It joined the Council of Europe in 1977, NATO in 1982, and the E.U. in 1986. The Socialist Workers' party controlled both houses of the Cortes from 1982 to 1996, but the party abandoned both Marxism and the traditional labor radicalism of prewar Spain. Instead, it resembled the mainstream Social Democratic parties of Western Europe. Under Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez Marquéz, Spain was for a time the economic darling of Europe. GDP grew by an average of almost 5 percent between 1986 and 1990, and business investment jumped by over 10 percent a year. In 1992, the Summer Olympics in Barcelona and the Universal Exposition in Seville focused world attention on two very different parts of Spain. But the economic growth slowed in 1992, unemployment reached 22 percent, and the conservative Popular party made strong gains in the Cortes in 1993. In 1994, Gonzalez's power eroded when several members of his government were indicted for their involvement with an antiterrorist death squad accused of assassinating 27 Basque separatists during the 1980's. After 10 years of Gonzalez and the Socialists, the May 1996 elections brought the Popular Party and its leader Jose Maria Aznar to governmental power (the Popular Party being supported by, though without a formal coalition with, Basque and Catalan nationalists). In July 1998, 12 officials of the Gonzalez government were sentenced to jail for crimes in the anti-Basque “dirty war,” although Gonzalez himself was not implicated. Spain's economy quickly reversed itself and annual growth surpassed three percent, so that Spain was able to meet the criteria for membership in the European Monetary Union. Somewhat unexpectedly the E.T.A., the Basque terrorist organization, declared on September 16, 1998, a “total and indefinite” cease-fire. But despite talks with the Aznar government and the release of “political prisoners,” the E.T.A., in late 1999, resumed its war with car-bombings and assassinations. In March 2000, the Popular Party won an unexpected majority (183 of 350 seats) in the Congresso (lower house). In Sept. 2002, two important leaders of E.T.A. were captured in France and government officials believed the group, responsible for over 800 deaths, would be crippled.","https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/spain.html","GEOGRAPHY Location: Iberian Peninsula in southwest Europe; Canary Is. off West Africa (28°07′N, 15°26′W).

Under the Habsburg dynasty (1516&#x2013;1700), Spain reached the zenith of its power and prestige around the year 1600 (despite the 1588 defeat of the Spanish Armada by England), controlling an empire that embraced nearly all of South America (except Brazil), Central America, Mexico, western North America, the Philippines, and smaller territories in Africa and Asia. But Spain's loss of the Netherlands, endless struggles with the French in Europe and the Turks in the Mediterranean, and relentless inflation caused by imports of New World silver&#x2014;all took their toll. During the 18th century, the Bourbons ruled a declining but still powerful Spain, until Napoleon installed his brother as king in 1808. After Napoleon's defeat, the Bourbons returned in 1814, but the loss of the South American colonies, three dynastic wars, and a brief republican interlude after 1868 were all signs of progressive weakness. The crowning blow to Spanish power and prestige was the loss of the Spanish-American War to the United States in 1898, leading to the independence of Cuba and the American takeover of Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Spain remained neutral in World War I. In 1923 Primo de Rivera established a dictatorship; he was forced out of office by King Alfonso XIII in 1930, but in 1931 the king was forced to abdicate. A republic replaced the monarchy. Its volatile mixture of socialism, anticlericalism, and decentralization provoked a right-wing reaction. The government moved to the Right, and in 1934 a miner's strike in Asturia was put down with great bloodshed. A left-wing government was elected in 1936 and deposed in a coup, which led to the terrible Civil War of 1936&#x2013;39, in which Spain became a battleground for competing world ideologies. The Nationalists, aided by Hitler and Mussolini, defeated the Republicans, aided by Stalin and by leftist volunteers from many countries. Out of the wreckage emerged the dictatorship of the intensely patriotic and Catholic general Francisco Franco. At the time of the Civil War, Spain was still an agricultural country, with small holdings in the north and great estates in the south. In the Basque country, the mining of iron, copper, and lead provided both exports and a domestic iron and steel industry, which had been the case since the 19th century. In the 20th century, shipbuilding and chemicals were added to the traditional textile industries of the Mediterranean coastal cities. The war largely destroyed this industrial base, which was not rebuilt until the 1950's. Except for a contingent of troops sent to fight with the German invaders of the Soviet Union, Spain remained precariously neutral during World War II; Franco declined to repay Hitler for his support in the Civil War. But wartime Spain, despite its neutrality, could not muster the resources to undertake national reconstruction. In postwar Europe, the Franco regime seemed like a remnant of the fascism of the 1930's; Stalin's active hostility led the United Nations to treat Spain as an international pariah. At home Franco represented peace and stability; few Spaniards were willing to risk a return to civil strife by opposing him. Over time the military and Catholic aspects of the regime grew more pronounced, while fascist elements were downplayed. In 1947 the Law of Succession made Spain a monarchy without a king, awaiting the restoration of the throne in the post-Franco era. The Cold War led to friendlier American relations with Spain and the establishment of American military bases in 1953. U.N. membership followed in 1955. Despite some resultant growth in international trade, Spain's economy lagged, with industrialization barely beginning. In 1958 Franco turned the direction of the economy over to a group of technocrats, mostly neoliberal members of the Opus Dei lay Catholic order. With U.S. economic and military aid, a growing tourist industry, increased foreign investment, and, especially, freer markets, the economy revived. Older industries like iron, steel, and textiles were rejuvenated, while newer ones, such as chemicals, plastics, automobile assembly, and power plants, were created. Agriculture was increasingly mechanized, and it shifted to export-oriented ranching and horticulture. In 1967 Franco proclaimed the Organic Law, which, while confirming him as head of state, granted some independence to the Cortes (legislature) and permitted heads of families to vote for some of its delegates. This, along with a relaxation of censorship, softened the growing opposition to the regime among students, labor unions, and regional separatists. In 1969 Prince Juan Carlos was named heir apparent to the Spanish throne. Franco died in 1975 and was duly succeeded by Juan Carlos. With the new prime minister, Adolfo Suarez, the king worked to liberalize the Franco inheritance: Political parties were legalized; the Cortes was transformed into a bicameral legislature, with both houses elected by universal suffrage; the first elections since 1936 were held; and a new constitution was promulgated&#x2014;all by 1978. In 1980, Catalonia and the Basque country were granted home rule, following overwhelming plebiscite victories. In the Basque lands, however, violent terrorist agitation for complete independence continues to this day. Under the new monarchy, Spain became a full participant in the affairs of Europe. It joined the Council of Europe in 1977, NATO in 1982, and the E.U. in 1986. The Socialist Workers' party controlled both houses of the Cortes from 1982 to 1996, but the party abandoned both Marxism and the traditional labor radicalism of prewar Spain. Instead, it resembled the mainstream Social Democratic parties of Western Europe. Under Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez Marqu&#xE9;z, Spain was for a time the economic darling of Europe. GDP grew by an average of almost 5 percent between 1986 and 1990, and business investment jumped by over 10 percent a year. In 1992, the Summer Olympics in Barcelona and the Universal Exposition in Seville focused world attention on two very different parts of Spain. But the economic growth slowed in 1992, unemployment reached 22 percent, and the conservative Popular party made strong gains in the Cortes in 1993. In 1994, Gonzalez's power eroded when several members of his government were indicted for their involvement with an antiterrorist death squad accused of assassinating 27 Basque separatists during the 1980's. After 10 years of Gonzalez and the Socialists, the May 1996 elections brought the Popular Party and its leader Jose Maria Aznar to governmental power (the Popular Party being supported by, though without a formal coalition with, Basque and Catalan nationalists). In July 1998, 12 officials of the Gonzalez government were sentenced to jail for crimes in the anti-Basque &#x201C;dirty war,&#x201D; although Gonzalez himself was not implicated. Spain's economy quickly reversed itself and annual growth surpassed three percent, so that Spain was able to meet the criteria for membership in the European Monetary Union. Somewhat unexpectedly the E.T.A., the Basque terrorist organization, declared on September 16, 1998, a &#x201C;total and indefinite&#x201D; cease-fire. But despite talks with the Aznar government and the release of &#x201C;political prisoners,&#x201D; the E.T.A., in late 1999, resumed its war with car-bombings and assassinations. In March 2000, the Popular Party won an unexpected majority (183 of 350 seats) in the Congresso (lower house). In Sept. 2002, two important leaders of E.T.A. were captured in France and government officials believed the group, responsible for over 800 deaths, would be crippled.

German federated troops served in the Roman legions, and Germanic invasions contributed to the fall of Rome. Most of Germany was united within the empire of Charlemagne. Divided among his three sons in 843, the empire's eastern regions became the heart of the Germanies. The Holy Roman Empire, founded in 962, gave some unity to the politically fragmented German territories, but its boundaries included more than Germany, and some Germans remained outside it. But that unity was fragile; the Holy Roman emperor was a feudal overlord rather than a ruler, and hundreds of separate political bodies coexisted within the imperial domain. Along the North Sea and Baltic coasts, the Hanseatic League controlled much of the commerce of northern Europe. With the Reformation in the 16th century, religious divisions added to Germany's existing political fragmentation and local allegiances. The Thirty Years War (1618–48) resulted in the virtual extinction of the Holy Roman Empire and left Germany without even a shadow of unity. After the Napoleonic Wars, in which much of Germany was conquered by France, the Congress of Vienna (1814–15) sanctioned the creation of a German League to succeed the Holy Roman Empire. The league consisted of 39 states, including five substantial kingdoms and the German parts of the Austrian empire. Prussia, one of the five kingdoms, had already risen to prominence under Frederick the Great in the 18th century. In a series of wars in the mid-19th century, Prussia conquered the other German states; after defeating France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Prussia declared the establishment of the German empire. Under its chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, Germany became a major European power in the late 19th century, with a booming industrial economy, flourishing agriculture, a small colonial empire, and growing military might. The German Empire reached its height under Kaiser Wilhelm II on the eve of World War I. Germany's disastrous defeat in that war was compounded by the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles (1919), which stripped Germany of its colonial empire, and returned part of Schleswig to Denmark, Alsace-Lorraine to France, and part of Prussia to Poland. The Weimar Republic, established in 1919, gradually overcame economic difficulties, including ruinous inflation, to achieve a measure of recovery in the 1920's. The republic was disrupted by labor strife, political fragmentation, and the rise of armed extremist political movements on both left and right. After the onset of the world economic depression in 1929, Adolf Hitler's National Socialist movement gained increasing power, both at the polls and through open thuggery against its opponents. Hitler's appointment as chancellor in 1933 effectively put an end to the Weimar Republic as a functioning democracy. The onset of World War II in Europe was presaged by Hitler's annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938 and precipitated by the German invasion of Poland in 1939. Early military successes gave Germany control of most of Europe, but the eventual victory of the Allied powers in 1945 left the country exhausted and in ruins. Much of the Jewish population of Germany, and of other territories under German control, had been killed during the Holocaust. German cities were reduced to rubble, and a quarter of the country's homes were uninhabitable. Famine and fuel shortages added to the general misery. Politically, Germany had essentially ceased to exist in 1945. The Allies divided the country into four zones of occupation, with a similar four-part division of Berlin. As the Cold War rift between the Western powers and the U.S.S.R. intensified during the late 1940's, so too the division of Germany hardened. In 1948 the U.S.S.R. imposed a blockade on West Berlin; the city was supplied by a massive airlift from the West for several months. In 1949 two Germanies were created: the German Democratic Republic in the Russian zone in the east, and the Federal Republic of Germany in the Allied zone in the west. The Federal Republic was largely the creation of one man, Konrad Adenauer. A veteran pre-Hitler politician, he founded the Federation of Christian Democratic Parties (CDU-CSU) in 1945, and as president of the Parliamentary Council formed during the occupation, he virtually wrote the new constitution for West Germany. In the first elections held in the Federal Republic (August 1949), the “bourgeois coalition” led by the CDU-CSU won a parliamentary majority in the Bundestag, and Adenauer became chancellor, a post he held for 14 years. In 1951 the Western powers granted the new state autonomy in foreign affairs, and recognized its full sovereignty in 1954. Even before the fighting in Germany subsided in 1945, the Soviet Air Force brought Walter Ulbricht, the exiled leader of the German Communist party, back to the U.S.S.R.'s zone of occupation in Germany. Backed by 20 Soviet divisions, Ulbricht and the party commenced the communization of the eastern zone. After local and state elections embarrassed the Communists, Stalin and Ulbricht forced all other parties into the National Front. With no other electoral lists permitted, voters gave a 99.7 percent approval to the National Front in the first elections to East Germany's “People's Chamber” in 1950. While Ulbricht attempted to collectivize agriculture and plan industrial development in the eastern zone, the Soviet Union extracted heavy reparations payments, bringing on an acute economic crisis. In June 1953, shortly after Stalin's death, strikes and riots erupted. The U.S.S.R. renounced further reparation payments and declared East Germany a sovereign state. In foreign affairs Adenauer relied heavily on friendship with the United States and reconciliation with France. He also supported European integration: In 1951 West Germany joined both the Council of Europe and the Coal and Steel Community. West Germany was admitted to NATO in 1955 and in 1957 became one of the six founding members of the EEC. In domestic affairs the political alliance between Adenauer and Ludwig Erhard led to political stability and the creation of a marketdriven economy. With a currency reform program and Marshall Plan aid in place by 1948 under occupation administration, the stage was set for Germany's “economic miracle” of the 1950's. Between 1949 and 1964, industrial production increased by 60 percent and gross national product tripled, while unemployment fell to 1 percent, even as millions of refugees from East Germany were integrated into the West German economy. In 1963 Erhard succeeded Adenauer as chancellor. Economic growth slowed to an annual 3 percent rate, but West Germany was already one of Europe's strongest economic powers, even providing jobs for hundreds of thousands of “guest workers” from southern Europe and Turkey. By 1963 East Germany had become the second-largest industrial power in Eastern Europe, and in 1968 it surpassed Czechoslovakia in output. A significant shift of labor to industry reduced the farm population to under 20 percent of total population by 1960. Though farming became mechanized, it remained relatively inefficient. Although East Germany enjoyed prestige within the Eastern bloc as an industrial power, the steady stream of emigrants to West Germany told a different story. After a renewed collectivization policy was implemented in 1960, the stream became a flood, and East Germany responded by building the Berlin Wall. The wall was a visible sign of political failure, but it did slow the stream of emigration to a trickle. Erhard resigned in 1966 when his coalition fell apart over the issue of a planned tax increase. He was succeeded by Kurt Kiesinger, who presided over a historic “great coalition” of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats. Under Willi Brandt (who served as deputy chancellor and foreign minister), the Social Democrats had shifted their orientation from a Marxist party to a reformist, market-oriented stance. Elections in 1969 produced a majority for the coalition headed by the Social Democrats who governed until 1982. Brandt succeeded Kiesinger and pursued an Ostpolitik (“opening to the east”), regularizing relations with East Germany, signing a nonagression pact with the U.S.S.R., and recognizing the border between East Germany and Poland. But domestically, West Germany suffered serious dislocations from the OPEC oil price increases of the early 1970's; inflation reached almost 8 percent. Revelations that a Brandt aide was an East German spy led to his replacement as chancellor by Helmut Schmidt in 1974. Schmidt continued Brandt's eastern policy but also pursued improved relations with the West. Economic difficulties persisted, however, and Schmidt's government fell in 1982. The Christian Democrats returned to power under chancellor Helmut Kohl. The improvement of the world economy in the 1980's led to economic recovery in Germany, boosting Kohl's popularity. Meanwhile, in East Germany an aging Ulbricht was replaced in May 1971 as party first secretary by Erich Honecker, who also became head of state in 1976. Honecker completed state ownership of all industry in 1972. After Brandt's Ostpolitik, the two Germanies grew closer, at least economically. East Germany's trade with West Germany gave it access to the EC. However, East Germany resisted Mikhail Gorbachev's reform policies in the 1980's, trying to establish itself as a model of old-style communism in Eastern Europe. In the fall of 1989 tens of thousands of East Germans fled to West Germany through Hungary and Czechoslovakia, triggering a series of dramatic demonstrations and the dismantling of the Berlin Wall in October. Honecker's government collapsed as the momentum for unification became unstoppable. In March 1990 Christian Democrat Lothar de Maizière was elected prime minister on a unification platform. In July an economic and fiscal union of the Germanies was completed, and in September the victorious wartime allies (the U.S., U.S.S.R., U.K., and France) agreed to a peace treaty that paved the way for political unification. On October 3, six regions of the former East Germany entered the Federal Republic as member states; eleven days later the Christian Democrats won elections in five of them, the Social Democrats winning one. In December 1990, all-German elections to the Bundestag were held for the first time in 58 years. The CDU-CSU and the Free Democrats won 398 seats, the Social Democrats 239. Helmut Kohl was sworn in as chancellor Jan. 17, 1991. In June Parliament voted to move the capital back to Berlin. In the years following unification, euphoria gave way to sober realism; economic restructuring would take many years, because the economy of East Germany proved to be in even worse shape than anyone imagined. Related to these economic woes was the wave of violent attacks by radical nationalists and neo-Nazi gangs upon immigrants and asylum seekers (who numbered over 2 million). In 1993 the government banned several violent groups and amended Germany's liberal asylum law to prevent refugees seeking economic betterment from entering the country. In the Bundestag elections of 1994, the Kohl coalition (CDU, CSU, and FD) maintained its majority over the opposition, led by the Social Democrats. Kohl was reelected chancellor, for a fourth time, as the economy remained strong. By 1996, however, unemployment was at an all-time postwar high and the Kohl government announced that the budget deficit required sweeping spending cuts, especially in social welfare programs. The economy worsened in 1997 and rebounded in 1998 but not enough to give Kohl another electoral victory as he lost to the Social Democrats and their leader, Gerhard Schröder. On Oct. 27, the Bundestag approved new Chancellor Schröder's “red-green” cabinet whose personnel and program appeared further left than Schröder. By March 1999, finance minister LaFontaine, an old-style SD, had been replaced by “moderate” Hans Eichel, financial markets responding positively. Already, in the previous month, the government coalition lost control of the state government of Hesse, thereby losing its majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house whose members are elected by the states, apparently dooming the government's plan to loosen citizenship restrictions (a major and controversial plank in the “red-green” platform). Schröder's attempts to introduce an austerity budget led to further electoral setbacks in state elections in Sep. 1999. The series of large Christian Democratic advances in state and municipal elections were brought to a halt with the revelations, at the end of 1999, of massive illegal contributions to the CDs over the years 1982–1998, leading to heavy fines upon the CDU and the ruin of the reputations of numerous CD politicians, preeminently of former chancellor Helmut Kohl. In return for a fine of 300,000 marks, prosecutors dropped charges against Kohl in 2001. In November the Schröder government narrowly (336–330) survived a vote of confidence over sending 4,000 troops to Afghanistan, but Schröder won re-election in Sept. 2002 in large part because of his opposition to a U.S. strike at Iraq. In 2003, faced with an enduring recession, growing unemployment and budget deficits, Schroeder proposed a reform package to cut unemployment benefits and government pensions, ease job-protection regulations and the Social Democrats grudgingly agreed to back him.","https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/germany.html","GEOGRAPHY Location: central Europe.

With a currency reform program and Marshall Plan aid in place by 1948 under occupation administration, the stage was set for Germany's &#x201C;economic miracle&#x201D; of the 1950's. Between 1949 and 1964, industrial production increased by 60 percent and gross national product tripled, while unemployment fell to 1 percent, even as millions of refugees from East Germany were integrated into the West German economy. In 1963 Erhard succeeded Adenauer as chancellor. Economic growth slowed to an annual 3 percent rate, but West Germany was already one of Europe's strongest economic powers, even providing jobs for hundreds of thousands of &#x201C;guest workers&#x201D; from southern Europe and Turkey. By 1963 East Germany had become the second-largest industrial power in Eastern Europe, and in 1968 it surpassed Czechoslovakia in output. A significant shift of labor to industry reduced the farm population to under 20 percent of total population by 1960. Though farming became mechanized, it remained relatively inefficient. Although East Germany enjoyed prestige within the Eastern bloc as an industrial power, the steady stream of emigrants to West Germany told a different story. After a renewed collectivization policy was implemented in 1960, the stream became a flood, and East Germany responded by building the Berlin Wall. The wall was a visible sign of political failure, but it did slow the stream of emigration to a trickle. Erhard resigned in 1966 when his coalition fell apart over the issue of a planned tax increase. He was succeeded by Kurt Kiesinger, who presided over a historic &#x201C;great coalition&#x201D; of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats. Under Willi Brandt (who served as deputy chancellor and foreign minister), the Social Democrats had shifted their orientation from a Marxist party to a reformist, market-oriented stance. Elections in 1969 produced a majority for the coalition headed by the Social Democrats who governed until 1982. Brandt succeeded Kiesinger and pursued an Ostpolitik (&#x201C;opening to the east&#x201D;), regularizing relations with East Germany, signing a nonagression pact with the U.S.S.R., and recognizing the border between East Germany and Poland. But domestically, West Germany suffered serious dislocations from the OPEC oil price increases of the early 1970's; inflation reached almost 8 percent. Revelations that a Brandt aide was an East German spy led to his replacement as chancellor by Helmut Schmidt in 1974. Schmidt continued Brandt's eastern policy but also pursued improved relations with the West. Economic difficulties persisted, however, and Schmidt's government fell in 1982. The Christian Democrats returned to power under chancellor Helmut Kohl. The improvement of the world economy in the 1980's led to economic recovery in Germany, boosting Kohl's popularity. Meanwhile, in East Germany an aging Ulbricht was replaced in May 1971 as party first secretary by Erich Honecker, who also became head of state in 1976. Honecker completed state ownership of all industry in 1972. After Brandt's Ostpolitik, the two Germanies grew closer, at least economically. East Germany's trade with West Germany gave it access to the EC. However, East Germany resisted Mikhail Gorbachev's reform policies in the 1980's, trying to establish itself as a model of old-style communism in Eastern Europe. In the fall of 1989 tens of thousands of East Germans fled to West Germany through Hungary and Czechoslovakia, triggering a series of dramatic demonstrations and the dismantling of the Berlin Wall in October. Honecker's government collapsed as the momentum for unification became unstoppable. In March 1990 Christian Democrat Lothar de Maizi&#xE8;re was elected prime minister on a unification platform. In July an economic and fiscal union of the Germanies was completed, and in September the victorious wartime allies (the U.S., U.S.S.R., U.K., and France) agreed to a peace treaty that paved the way for political unification. On October 3, six regions of the former East Germany entered the Federal Republic as member states; eleven days later the Christian Democrats won elections in five of them, the Social Democrats winning one. In December 1990, all-German elections to the Bundestag were held for the first time in 58 years. The CDU-CSU and the Free Democrats won 398 seats, the Social Democrats 239. Helmut Kohl was sworn in as chancellor Jan. 17, 1991. In June Parliament voted to move the capital back to Berlin. In the years following unification, euphoria gave way to sober realism; economic restructuring would take many years, because the economy of East Germany proved to be in even worse shape than anyone imagined. Related to these economic woes was the wave of violent attacks by radical nationalists and neo-Nazi gangs upon immigrants and asylum seekers (who numbered over 2 million). In 1993 the government banned several violent groups and amended Germany's liberal asylum law to prevent refugees seeking economic betterment from entering the country. In the Bundestag elections of 1994, the Kohl coalition (CDU, CSU, and FD) maintained its majority over the opposition, led by the Social Democrats. Kohl was reelected chancellor, for a fourth time, as the economy remained strong. By 1996, however, unemployment was at an all-time postwar high and the Kohl government announced that the budget deficit required sweeping spending cuts, especially in social welfare programs. The economy worsened in 1997 and rebounded in 1998 but not enough to give Kohl another electoral victory as he lost to the Social Democrats and their leader, Gerhard Schr&#xF6;der. On Oct. 27, the Bundestag approved new Chancellor Schr&#xF6;der's &#x201C;red-green&#x201D; cabinet whose personnel and program appeared further left than Schr&#xF6;der. By March 1999, finance minister LaFontaine, an old-style SD, had been replaced by &#x201C;moderate&#x201D; Hans Eichel, financial markets responding positively. Already, in the previous month, the government coalition lost control of the state government of Hesse, thereby losing its majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house whose members are elected by the states, apparently dooming the government's plan to loosen citizenship restrictions (a major and controversial plank in the &#x201C;red-green&#x201D; platform). Schr&#xF6;der's attempts to introduce an austerity budget led to further electoral setbacks in state elections in Sep. 1999. The series of large Christian Democratic advances in state and municipal elections were brought to a halt with the revelations, at the end of 1999, of massive illegal contributions to the CDs over the years 1982&#x2013;1998, leading to heavy fines upon the CDU and the ruin of the reputations of numerous CD politicians, preeminently of former chancellor Helmut Kohl. In return for a fine of 300,000 marks, prosecutors dropped charges against Kohl in 2001. In November the Schr&#xF6;der government narrowly (336&#x2013;330) survived a vote of confidence over sending 4,000 troops to Afghanistan, but Schr&#xF6;der won re-election in Sept. 2002 in large part because of his opposition to a U.S. strike at Iraq. In 2003, faced with an enduring recession, growing unemployment and budget deficits, Schroeder proposed a reform package to cut unemployment benefits and government pensions, ease job-protection regulations and the Social Democrats grudgingly agreed to back him.

Portugal traces its origins back to the warlike Lusitanian tribes of Roman times. The nation-state originated as a county of the kingdom of Leon-Castile, reconquered from the Moors in the 11th century. Portugal won recognition as an independent kingdom in 1143, and conquered Lisbon four years later. In 1267 the Algarve was conquered, and by then Portugal had expanded to its modern boundaries. Except for the period 1580–1640, when it was ruled by the Spanish Habsburgs, the Portuguese dynasty maintained its independence into the 20th century. Portuguese fishermen had probably frequented the Grand Banks from before the time of Columbus, and the nation's tradition of seafaring gave rise to a world empire in the 15th and 16th centuries. Prince Henry the Navigator (1394–1460) colonized the Azores and the Madeiras and sponsored voyages of exploration along the west coast of Africa. Under his successors, Portugal controlled the west African coast, the shores of the Indian Ocean, and large stretches of southern Asia, as well as, in the Western Hemisphere, Brazil. Yet the rise of the empires of Spain and the Netherlands quickly reduced the Portuguese to second-rank status, leaving only Macao, Goa, and Timor in Asia; Portuguese Guinea (Guinea Bissau), Mozambique, and Angola in Africa; and the great territory of Brazil in Latin America. In the 19th century, a series of dynastic civil wars weakened the monarchy, allowing Britain to gain control of the country's foreign policy (in addition to the wine trade of Oporto, long in British hands). Brazil declared its independence in 1822. In 1910 Portugal became the first kingdom in the 20th century to be transformed into a republic. But in the next 15 years, chaos ensued: eight presidents, 44 governments, and a nearcollapse of the economy. Finally, the military established a dictatorship, lasting until recent times. In 1928 the military installed a civilian dictator, a professor of economics, Antonio Salazar. A firm believer in law and order, he managed to control the turbulence of political life and made the escudo one of Europe's most stable currencies, yet he could do nothing to alter Portugal's fundamental poverty. Although he ruled through civilian governments, his essential support always came from the army. Portugal has long been Western Europe's poorest country. As late as 1960, almost half of the country's work force was engaged in agriculture, forestry, and fishing. In the north, agriculture was traditionally carried on in smallholdings; the south was characterized by large estates, remnants of feudal fiefs. Exports were traditionally cork, olive oil, port wine, and fish. Industrialization came late to Portugal, and today manufacturing is mostly carried on by small firms engaged in textile and clothing production and other labor-intensive production. World War II affected Portugal very little. Salazar deftly managed to remain Britain's ally while keeping his country out of the war as a neutral state. In the postwar period, Portugal accepted Marshall Plan aid and became a member of NATO in 1949. Portugal was a founding member of the European Free Trade Association in 1959 and negotiated a special relationship with the EC in 1972 (when its trading partner and ally, Great Britain, joined that body). Portugal joined the United Nations in 1955, just in time to become embroiled in the worldwide movement for decolonization. Protesting that Portugal had, not colonies, but “overseas provinces,” Salazar refused to bow to the pressure of world opinion. In 1961 India forcibly annexed Goa and other Portuguese enclaves on the subcontinent. In the same year, nationalist revolts broke out in Angola, Guinea and Mozambique. The colonial wars of the 1960's placed a terrible strain on Portugal's economy and resulted in severe military losses. Salazar, gravely ill, retired in 1968 and was replaced by Marcelo Caetano. In 1974 Caetano was deposed in a bloodless coup staged by the secret Armed Forces movement. The coup's leader, Antonio de Spinola, after reaching agreements on the independence of most of Portugal's old colonies, resigned as head of government in September 1974. Costa Gomes replaced Spinola, as a Revolutionary Council was instituted. The council survived two coup attempts, one by right-wing soldiers, the other by Communists, and it promulgated a Socialist constitution in 1976. Through a series of unstable governments (16 between 1974 and 1987), the old agrarian estates were expropriated, and banking, insurance, and large industrial concerns were nationalized. The shock of this economic transformation, along with the OPEC price rises, created a recession in the 1970's. In addition Portugal had to absorb a million Portuguese refugees from the former colonies. Attempts by center-right coalitions in the 1980's to undo the nationalizations of the 1970's were thwarted by vetoes of the Constitutional Tribunal (successor to the Revolutionary Council), even when the free-market Social Democratic party held an absolute majority in the assembly. Portugal entered the EC on Jan. 1, 1986, pledging to reduce tariffs and end agricultural subsidies over a 10-year transitional period. In 1987 the Social Democrats, running on a platform of spending cuts, privatization of state-owned firms, reversal of agricultural collectivism, and reliance on free enterprise, became the first party since 1974 to win an absolute majority in the legislative assembly. Per capita income tripled over the years 1985–92, so that Portugal was no longer the poorest country in the E.U. The 1992 sale of the huge state-owned Petrogal oil company was a harbinger of a return to free enterprise. In Oct. 1995, Antonio Guterres of the Socialist party displaced the Social Democrats. And in January 1996, Jorge Sampaio won the presidential election, giving Portugal both a Socialist president and prime minister for the first time since democracy was restored. Portugal's economic stability was ratified in 1998 by the E.U. when the latter approved Portugal's membership in the Monetary Union. GDP growth averaged 3.5 percent through the late 1990's. In Dec. 1999 the colony of Macao was returned to Chinese rule after 442 years. In 2001 Sampaio was easily reelected. But the December loss by the Socialists of numerous municipal elections, including Lisbon and Oporto, led Sampaio to dissolve Parliament. March elections then brought another center-right coalition as the Social Democrats took 102 (of 230) seats, selecting Manual Durao Barroso as prime minister.","https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/portugal.html","GEOGRAPHY Location: Iberian Peninsula in southwest Europe; also two archipelagos in Atlantic Ocean: Azores (37°29′N, 25°40′W) and Madeira Islands (32°40′N, 16°55′W).

At the time of European contact in the early 16th century, coastal Venezuela was home to nearly 50,000 semisedentary Indians. Although the region was “discovered” by Christopher Columbus in 1498, European settlement of the area was slow in comparison with the neighboring region of New Granada. The Spaniards explored and exploited Venezuela in the 1520's, searching for gold and pearls. Early attempts at agriculture by the Spaniards failed until they discovered that the area around Caracas (founded in 1567) could sustain the production of both wheat and cocoa. African slave labor was an important part of the economic structure, and as markets for cocoa expanded, Caracas grew in importance. Venezuela became a captaincy general (an administrative region below the level of viceroyalty) with an audiencia (high court) established at Caracas in 1777–78. As early as 1797, Venezuelan society was in rebellion against the Spanish empire. A major hindrance to the revolutionary leadership of Simón Bolívar was the need to accommodate both conservative landowners and the pardos, lower class citizens of mixed African and European ancestry. The wars of independence were particularly destructive in Venezuela, but in 1821 the region achieved independence and became part of the federation of Gran Colombia, which also included New Granada and Ecuador. By 1830 Gran Colombia was in a state of political collapse, and Venezuela became an independent republic. The military caudillo (leader) José Antonio Páez controlled the country for three decades. With the demise of Páez and his conservative allies in the 1860's, the forces of liberalism under Antonio Guzmán Blanco took over. The Guzmán Blanco era ended during a brief civil war in 1889, won by Gen. Cipriano Castro, who proceeded to establish his own rule. In 1908 Gen. Juan Vicente Gómez occupied the presidency, and he controlled the politics of Venezuela until his death in 1935. The shift from dictatorship to democracy began with the Generation of 28, a student movement that organized urban workers and peasants into a viable political opposition. The Generation of 28 later became the modern Democratic Action party. In 1945 a group of young military officers overthrew the conservative dictatorship and supported the Democratic Action group in writing a new democratic constitution. Democratic Action won the elections of 1947, but military elements overthrew the new government the following year. The coup brought Col. Marcos Pérez Jiménez to power until his ouster in 1958. The election of Democratic Action candidate Romulo Betancourt as president marked the beginning of multiparty democratic politics in Venezuela. The stability of the system owed much to political possibilities provided by the country's petroleum revenues. Venezuela nationalized foreign-owned oil and iron firms in 1975 and 1976, but dependence on petroleum revenues still precipitated economic and political problems for the country in the 1980's. The downturn of the global oil market caused Venezuela's economic base to shrink, and the country's massive foreign debt hindered the expansion of populist political strategies. The Christian Democrats defeated Democratic Action in 1968 and again in 1978. Pres. Luis Herrera Campíns's administration (1979–84) took the country in a more conservative direction but Democratic Action regained the presidency in 1983 under Jaime Lusinchi. Venezuela's huge foreign debt in the 1980's led to tight economic controls and a reduction in social spending. The administration of Pres. Carlos Andrés Perez, elected in 1989, began with antigovernment riots in which hundreds died. In Feb. 1992, Latin America's oldest civilian government thwarted an attempted coup by soldiers angered over connections between high-ranking officers and drug traffickers; a second coup in November also failed. But in early 1993, Pres. Perez was suspended after the Senate ordered impeachment proceedings against him on charges he embezzled $17 million from the government; the Congress overwhelmingly elected Sen. Ramon Jose Valasquez Mujica to serve as interim president. In early 1994 Rafael Caldera became president and immediately faced severe economic problems as the currency depreciated by more than 80 percent. Caldera imposed price and currency controls and suspended several constitutional guarantees. In July 1995, he restored those rights, except along Venezuela's borders with Colombia and Brazil, where crime and economic crises were most severe. Violent anti-government demonstrations continued into 1996 but Caldera persisted in austerity plans that resulted in a $1.4 bil. loan from I.M.F. By early 1997 inflation seemed to be in check and the economy stabilizing although the continuing fall in worldwide oil prices added more pressure for budget cuts. By 1998 Venezuela's economy was caught in the worldwide financial crisis and spinning toward chaos as the presidential election approached. In the December elections, the two old parties (Christian Democrats and Democratic Action) which had dominated for 40 years all but disappeared. The Patriotic Pole Coalition candidate, Hugo Chavez Frias (who had led the unsuccessful coup in 1992 against Perez) easily triumphed over Henrique Salas Romer. Two days later stock shares rose 22 percent despite Chavez' calls for redistribution of wealth, privatization of the government oil company and abolition of Congress. Chavez called for a Constitutional Assembly to rewrite the constitution (88 percent voted their approval in April 1999). In elections for the Assembly Chavez's supporters won all but seven of 128 seats. In December the Assembly adopted a new constitution (Venezuela's 26th) whose major features are a unicameral National Assembly and a six-year renewable presidential term. Elections in Aug. 2000 confirmed Chavez for a new term and “Chavista” dominance of the Assembly. Chavez demanded OPEC cut production and travelled to major oil producers (including Iraq) to make his point. He agreed to sell oil to Castro's Cuba at bargain prices. In Nov. the new National Assembly gave him authority to rule by decree in 37 legislative areas. But Chavez's excesses (such as decreeing 49 new laws in one day) provoked resistance by both business and labor, both of whom backed an army coup attempt on April 12, 2002. Within 48 hours, however, Chavez was back, the coup undercut by jealousy and divisions in the armed forces. A general strike, called in Oct. by business and labor groups, became a crisis for the regime when 30,000 oil workers joined. The O.A.S. brokered an agreement that both sides would disarm civilian supporters and recognize a constitutional right to a recall referendum. In Sept. 2003 the National Electoral Council rejected the petition signed by 3.2 million people demanding a recall referendum. The opposition, backed by the U.S., vowed to try again.","https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/venezuela.html","GEOGRAPHY Location: northern coast of South America.

At the time of European contact in the early 16th century, coastal Venezuela was home to nearly 50,000 semisedentary Indians. Although the region was &#x201C;discovered&#x201D; by Christopher Columbus in 1498, European settlement of the area was slow in comparison with the neighboring region of New Granada. The Spaniards explored and exploited Venezuela in the 1520's, searching for gold and pearls. Early attempts at agriculture by the Spaniards failed until they discovered that the area around Caracas (founded in 1567) could sustain the production of both wheat and cocoa. African slave labor was an important part of the economic structure, and as markets for cocoa expanded, Caracas grew in importance. Venezuela became a captaincy general (an administrative region below the level of viceroyalty) with an audiencia (high court) established at Caracas in 1777&#x2013;78. As early as 1797, Venezuelan society was in rebellion against the Spanish empire. A major hindrance to the revolutionary leadership of Sim&#xF3;n Bol&#xED;var was the need to accommodate both conservative landowners and the pardos, lower class citizens of mixed African and European ancestry. The wars of independence were particularly destructive in Venezuela, but in 1821 the region achieved independence and became part of the federation of Gran Colombia, which also included New Granada and Ecuador. By 1830 Gran Colombia was in a state of political collapse, and Venezuela became an independent republic. The military caudillo (leader) Jos&#xE9; Antonio P&#xE1;ez controlled the country for three decades. With the demise of P&#xE1;ez and his conservative allies in the 1860's, the forces of liberalism under Antonio Guzm&#xE1;n Blanco took over. The Guzm&#xE1;n Blanco era ended during a brief civil war in 1889, won by Gen. Cipriano Castro, who proceeded to establish his own rule. In 1908 Gen. Juan Vicente G&#xF3;mez occupied the presidency, and he controlled the politics of Venezuela until his death in 1935. The shift from dictatorship to democracy began with the Generation of 28, a student movement that organized urban workers and peasants into a viable political opposition. The Generation of 28 later became the modern Democratic Action party. In 1945 a group of young military officers overthrew the conservative dictatorship and supported the Democratic Action group in writing a new democratic constitution. Democratic Action won the elections of 1947, but military elements overthrew the new government the following year. The coup brought Col. Marcos P&#xE9;rez Jim&#xE9;nez to power until his ouster in 1958. The election of Democratic Action candidate Romulo Betancourt as president marked the beginning of multiparty democratic politics in Venezuela. The stability of the system owed much to political possibilities provided by the country's petroleum revenues.

" INTERNATIONAL   A3-17    Two C.I.A. Reports Warn About Situation in Iraq  A classified cable sent by the Central Intelligence Agency's station chief in Baghdad has warned that the situation in Iraq is deteriorating and may not rebound any time soon, according to government officials. They also said its basic conclusions had been echoed in briefings presented by a senior C.I.A. official.   A1    Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld indicated that he expected American troops to withdraw from Iraq within four years, but he cautioned that any final decision hinged on the progress of Iraq's civilian government and security forces.   A11    A rift has developed among the major Shiite political groups in Iraq, which could lead to fierce competition for votes in national elections and could alter the religious and political alignment of the countrys new national assembly.   A11    Attack on U.S. Consulate  Five attackers thought to be linked to Al Qaeda staged a brazen daytime raid on the American Consulate in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, storming through the sprawling compounds fortified gate and starting a three-hour gun battle that left five local embassy employees and four of the attackers dead.   A1    No Deal Yet in Ukraine  Ukraine's fractious lawmakers reached a tentative agreement on political reforms to end a political stalemate before a new presidential election later this month. But President Leonid D. Kuchma and the two presidential contenders failed to approve the deal.   A6    President Vladimir V. Putin adjusted his hard-line position on the presidential election, saying that he would accept the choice of the Ukrainian people and would work with whichever candidate wins.   A6    NATIONAL   A18-24    Leaders in Congress Reach Final Agreement on Spy Bill  Congressional leaders said they had reached final agreement allowing passage of a bill to overhaul the nation's intelligence community and enact the major recommendations of the independent Sept. 11 commission, including the creation of the job of national intelligence director.

The F.B.I. is investigating.   A18    Interrogation Tactics Faulted  The F.B.I. repeatedly criticized ''aggressive interrogation practices'' that its agents observed being used by the military at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, a series of confidential memorandums show.   A19    Grocery Worker Settlement  Three of California's largest supermarket chains and a group of immigrant janitors said they had reached a tentative $22.4 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by the workers, who said they often earned just $3.50 an hour and were never paid overtime.   A19    Medicare Regions Released  In the first big step to make prescription drug benefits available to the elderly, the Bush administration said it would carve the nation into 34 regions to administer the new Medicare program, which begins in January 2006.   A20    Ohio Vote Becomes Official  The Ohio secretary of state officially certified that President Bush won the state by 119,000 votes, but an array of groups continued to question the results.   A18    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-9    Trade Center Insurers Ordered to Pay Double  A federal jury said the destruction of the World Trade Center constituted two separate attacks, entitling the developer Larry A. Silverstein to collect up to $2.2 billion, or double the insurance coverage provided by nine insurers at the complex.   A1    Welfare Curb for Immigrants  A class-action lawsuit expected to be filed today says New York State is violating the federal and state Constitutions by denying standard welfare benefits to impoverished elderly, blind or disabled immigrants.

" INTERNATIONAL  A3-14    North Korea Agrees to End Nuclear Arms Program  North Korea agreed to end its nuclear weapons program in return for security, economic and energy benefits, potentially easing tensions with the United States after a two-year standoff over the country's efforts to build atomic bombs. The agreement with the six countries participating in the talks, is a preliminary one that would require future rounds of negotiations to flesh out, as it does not address a range of issues like timing and implementation.  A1    No Winner in German Election  After a bitterly fought campaign that many people in Germany had believed only a few days ago would produce a historic vote for change, the electorate failed to give any party or candidate a clear majority.  A1    In an election that produced no winner, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder provided a facsimile of one, bounding to a stage to raucous applause, his hands clasped above his head in a victory gesture. Playing on the fears of change-averse Germans, he battled back from a deficit to bring his party to a virtual draw with the Christian Democrats.  A10    Afghan Voters Take Next Step  Millions of Afghans voted in the country's first contested legislative elections in more than a quarter of a century, the last formal step toward Afghanistan's transition to a democratic government following the American-led military ouster of the Taliban government nearly four years ago. Results of the vote are to be announced next month.  A1    Shiite Endurance Tested  Insurgents in Iraq have pointedly shifted their focus toward killing Shiite civilians, with the number of attacks rising sharply since the spring. If the country has not yet slid into open civil war, it is mainly because a vast majority of Shiites refused to be drawn into the killing.  A1    Uzbek Refugees Live in Fear  The 439 Uzbek refugees living in a United Nations camp in Romania still fear their government's reach. They are the largest group of survivors of what human rights groups say was a massacre at the hands of Uzbek security forces, who in May acted to put down an armed uprising in the city of Andijan, killing hundreds of people.  A3    NATIONAL  A16-21    Official Urges DelayOf New Orleans Return  Citing health and safety concerns, the top official in charge of the federal response to Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts urged a delay to a plan that is slowly bringing people back to a city largely without power, drinking water or a working 911 system.  A1    More than a quarter of the dead recovered so far in New Orleans are patients, mostly elderly, who died in hospitals or nursing homes, according to interviews with officials from eight area hospitals and 26 nursing homes. By the scores, people without choice of whether to leave or stay died in New Orleans, trapped in health care facilities and in many cases abandoned by their would-be government rescuers.  A1    Only now are searchers beginning to force their way into homes in a neighborhood just south of Lake Pontchartrain and part of the Gentilly section of New Orleans. While much of the rest of the city is drying out and making steps towards recovery, this mostly middle-class neighborhood's topography and promixity to a breach in the London Avenue Canal has made it the largest remaining swath of the city still under water.   A19    Former President Bill Clinton, asked by President Bush to help raise money for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, offered harsh public criticism of the Bush administration's disaster-relief effort, saying, ''You can't have an emergency plan that works if it only affects middle-class people up.''

Since the Fed's campaign to lift rates started in June 2004, that statement has said that rates were likely to increase at a measured pace.

" ENERGY    The News -- It was cold in the Northeast, and snow was predicted, so naturally, energy prices rose. Oil was over $60 a barrel, and natural gas was at record levels.    Behind the News -- So far, the holiday shopping season has been so-so, and high energy costs could lead shoppers to spend even less in the days up to Christmas. This would be bad news for retailers and their employees, and the overall economy.    GOLD    The News -- The gold bugs are back. Gold is near $500 an ounce for the first time since 1987.    Behind the News -- The price of gold was $253.70 on Aug. 25, 1999. Since then, it has almost doubled. Traditionally, rising gold prices were taken as a sign that investors were worried about inflation. This time, however, some say that the Asian economic boom is creating a rising demand for gold jewelry. Either way, that little bauble someone wanted as a holiday present will carry a higher price this year.    TRADE DEFICIT    The News -- The United States' trade deficit hit a record $68.9 billion in October, $3 billion higher than the previous month.    Behind the News -- The trade deficit is expected to top $700 billion this year, up from last year's record $618 billion, and is likely to cut into economic growth. Democrats accused President Bush of being soft on countries that are running a trade surplus with the United States, especially China and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The trade deficit with China through October was $166.8 billion, while that with OPEC nations was $77 billion.      Some Republicans, too, expressed worry. ''Small-business owners in Maine and across the nation are fighting to remain competitive with countries such as China that flagrantly disregard fair trade practices,'' said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine. The deficit numbers also added to the rumors that John W. Snow, the treasury secretary, would be replaced.    INTEREST RATES    The News -- The Federal Reserve Board raised the key federal funds rate by a quarter point, to 4.25 percent.    Behind the News -- Investors had hoped the Fed would hint that its inflation fight was nearly over. Instead, it said that low unemployment, strong economic growth, high energy prices and big deficits made inflation a continuing threat. More rates rises could slow the economy, hurting Republicans, and Democrats have charged that the administration has done little to keep down energy prices.","https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/weekinreview/the-week-what-goes-up-dec-11-17.html","ENERGY    The News -- It was cold in the Northeast, and snow was predicted, so naturally, energy prices rose.

" WHITHER THE MARKETS? -- Markets open tomorrow after lackluster late-December trading that was notable mostly for the bond market's inverted yield curve, in which the yields of 2-year Treasury notes moved higher than those on 10-year notes. Economists say they believe the aberration may -- or may not -- presage an economic slowdown. Here are some predictions for the weeks ahead: The dollar, bolstered by the prospect of another interest-rate hike, will gain a bit against the yen and the euro; the price of oil will stay above $60 as OPEC keeps a lid on supplies; gold, which shot up 18.3 percent last year, to $518.90 for February delivery, will continue its ascent; housing prices will cool; stocks will keep dillydallying; and that pesky inverted yield curve will go away.    ABOUT THOSE RATE INCREASES -- Let us not forget that a few lonely prognosticators think that the Federal Reserve, under the stewardship of Alan Greenspan's successor, Ben S. Bernanke, above, will surprise everybody (except them) by holding interest rates steady at the Fed's next meeting. With that in mind, soothsayers of all stripes will be studying the minutes of the central bank's Dec. 13 policy-setting meeting, which will be made public tomorrow.

"Two weeks ago, a brief Russia-Ukraine squabble over natural gas pricing sent a tremor through Europe. One week ago, another tremor swept through the West -- this time America joined in the shakes -- when Iran broke open internationally monitored seals on its nuclear facilities, clearing the way for uranium enrichment activities that are a big step toward making a nuclear weapon.      These two events, in different ways, illustrate the dangers of relying as heavily as the West does on imported energy, much of it coming from chronically unstable countries. The United States, as the world's biggest and most profligate energy consumer, could do more than any other country to lessen this dangerous dependency, and in that way reduce the geopolitical leverage of capricious supplier nations.

The decision had been widely anticipated but it still helped ease some of the concern on oil markets. [C2.]    Oil producers, particularly in the Arabian peninsula, are going through an oil boom. And as in the 1970's and 1980's, there is an abundance of outrageous projects.

The question hovering over his testimony is whether prosecutors will be able to use him to prove a broader conspiracy at Enron or the defense will be able to convince the jury that the fraudulent buck stopped with Mr. Fastow. (Monday.)    BOOK 'EM -- The literary trial of this century (so far) continues in London as two authors of the book, ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' claim that the writer Dan Brown appropriated much of their work for his phenomenal best seller, ''The Da Vinci Code.'' For media companies, the trial is not all British legal comedy: the outcome could bar Random House from continuing to sell the book in England and Columbia Pictures from releasing its movie adaptation, starring Tom Hanks, there as well.

Pixar's chief rival in feature animation, DreamWorks Animation, also reports this week. (Thursday.) DreamWorks will release its next feature, ''Over the Hedge,'' later this year.

Judging by the success of other markets that have gone public, seat holders could see a windfall. (Wednesday.)

With both prices and demand still high, OPEC is expected to maintain current production levels. (Wednesday.)

" As Wal-Mart Works With Bloggers, Questions Arise on Their Independence  Under assault as never before, Wal-Mart is looking beyond the mainstream media and working directly with bloggers, feeding them exclusive nuggets of news, suggesting topics for postings and even inviting them to visit its headquarters. The strategy raises questions about what bloggers, who pride themselves on independence, should disclose to readers. [Page C1.]    NBC Universal to Buy iVillage for $600 Million  IVillage, the Internet company devoted to women, agreed to be acquired by NBC Universal for $600 million. The sale of iVillage, one of the last major publicly traded Internet companies based in New York, comes as major media companies, recovering from their misadventures online in the Internet bubble of the late 1990's, started acquiring online companies last year. NBC Universal's chief executive, Robert Wright, said that iVillage offered a way to expand the company's exposure to the rapidly growing Internet advertising market and to connect to the coverage of women's issues and health issues that NBC already creates. Market Place. [C1.]    After AT&T Deal, an Industry With Fewer Players  Is bigger necessarily better when it comes to running a telecommunications company? Apparently, AT&T thinks so, as it announced plans to buy BellSouth for $67 billion. Yet AT&T's ambitions have raised questions about whether its strategy of gobbling up its rivals has reached the point of diminishing returns. [C1.]    Despite new technological choices in phone service, consumer groups argue that, by and large, industry consolidation has reduced choice for most consumers who are not ready yet to abandon their traditional phone lines. [C6.]    The AT&T deal threatens to undermine parts of the telephone industry's broader regulatory and legislative agenda by making it hard for the industry to claim it badly needs relief from regulators and Congress. [C1.]    The takeover will have a big impact on Madison Avenue because so many agencies have been spending so much money on behalf of AT&T and BellSouth as well as their mobile communications joint venture, Cingular Wireless. [C7.]    Some OPEC Ministers Say Output Should Be Reduced  So far, oil producers have the best of all worlds: high prices and high demand. But because demand for some oil products typically slows in the second quarter, allowing refiners to build stocks of gasoline, some of OPEC's harder-line ministers have argued that the group should pare its output to avoid a sharp price drop.

The Dow Jones industrial average declined 63 points, to 10,958.59. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.97 points, to 1,278.26, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 16.57 points, to 2,286.03. [C10.]    Lawyers Claim Merck Hid Risk of Vioxx  The legal fight over Vioxx returned to a New Jersey courtroom, with lawyers for two men who blame their heart attacks on the painkiller telling jurors that its manufacturer, Merck, knowingly concealed its risks from consumers. But the company's lead lawyer dismissed those claims, attributing the heart attacks to other health problems and saying Merck rigorously studied Vioxx for more than seven years and complied with regulatory requirements for new drugs.

" OFFER FOR KINDER MORGAN -- A group led by Richard D. Kinder announced a buyout offer valued at $22 billion for Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent of the pipeline giant he founded in 1997. The deal, which includes the assumption of about $8 billion in debt, would be the largest leveraged buyout since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company bought RJR Nabisco in 1989 for $25 billion. [Page C1.]    TWO IN NEWS CREW KILLED -- Two Britons working as members of a CBS News television crew were killed on Monday and an American correspondent for the network, Kimberly Dozier, was critically wounded when a military patrol they were accompanying was hit by a roadside bomb. [A1.]    THE BATTLE FOR AIR -- Americans are increasingly recognizing that the effects of carbon emissions on global warming are a serious problem, but there are no rules in the United States regulating heat-trapping gases comparable to those that most other developed countries have adopted under the Kyoto Protocol. Some United States businesses, though, are responding for a variety of reasons anyway: to satisfy customers or shareholders who worry about the environment, to improve their public image or to drive down their energy costs. In addition, some states and local authorities have stepped in to try to curb their contributions to global warming. [C1.]    A STEEL WAR -- When it came to repelling a hostile takeover bid from Mittal Steel, Arcelor left no stone unturned as it searched for a poison-pill partner. But some critics say that the solution -- a deal that gives more than a third of Arcelor to a Russian billionaire, Aleksei Mordashov, left, may leave a bitter aftertaste. If it is approved by the shareholders, the agreement will put Russian executives in crucial management positions at Arcelor, raising questions about integration between the two corporate cultures, and concerns among some shareholders about what role the Russian government may want to play. [C3.]    HISPANIC CALLERS -- Now that nearly three out of four people in this country have mobile phone service, cellphone companies are chasing new customers by marketing to ever more specific slices of the population. But one group is getting extra attention: Hispanics. And there is ample reason for the carriers' attention. One of the country's fastest growing demographic groups, Hispanics often have large families that span international borders, making for larger phone bills. [C1.]    THAT 60'S SHOW -- AMC cable television network is considering a series that would explore how Madison Avenue remakes itself to meet the changing needs of clients as consumers and the media undergo transformation. So the show would be a reality series, right? Not exactly. It is fictional, a drama about the advertising industry circa 1960. In another example of how the more things change the more they remain the same, if AMC decides to pick up the series, each episode may be sponsored by a single advertiser -- just as was done in 1960. Stuart Elliott, Advertising. [C7.]    A SUMMER OF HIGH GAS PRICES -- As the summer travel season began in earnest this past weekend, Americans were indulging their wanderlust, jamming highways, and filling airports, motels and eateries. But in some small ways, with possibly large consequences for the health of the economy, travelers interviewed across the country over the weekend said they were cutting their spending and downsizing their plans for summer trips. [A1.]    A MOVE IN EUROPE -- When BAE Systems, the British military contractor, announced that it was bowing out of its nearly 30-year relationship with Airbus, the split was greeted in Britain with shock at first, followed by recognition that the companies had grown apart. BAE's departure now could be transformational not only for it, but also for Airbus, whose ownership -- and decision-making -- structure is evolving. [C4.]    BRIGHT SPOT FOR G.M. -- Four years ago, Daewoo Motor was the biggest and ugliest addition to South Korea's junkyard of bankrupt companies. Its parent conglomerate had collapsed, and most potential investors were intimidated by its militant labor union. Its founder, Kim Woo Choong, left, is on trial on corruption charges linked to the disintegration of his conglomerate in 1998. But Mr. Kim is gone, and Daewoo has become a bright spot for G.M. [C4.]    AIRLINE APOLOGIZES -- WestJet Airlines agreed on Monday to pay 15.5 million Canadian dollars ($14 million) to settle accusations of spying on an internal Web site of its rival, Air Canada. The settlement, which came with an apology, brought to an end two years of litigation. [C9.]    THE OPEC MEETING -- Most delegates at this week's meeting of OPEC are expected to nod politely to Venezuela's calls for output cuts that could drive prices even higher, while doing the opposite by reaping all they can from the current bonanza of high prices. The oil minister of the United Arab Emirates rejected talk of a possible cut in the cartel's output quotas of 28 million barrels a day. [C1.]    A SOFTWARE BATTLE IN CHINA -- Responding to years of intensive international lobbying, the Chinese government has introduced measures offering the potential to curb widespread piracy and increase revenue for software companies. The Business Software Alliance estimates that more than 90 percent of the software in China is unlicensed. [C3.]    A NEW TAX COMPLAINT -- In an effort to raise revenues, tax writers in Congress added a last-minute provision that increased taxes for Americans living abroad.
