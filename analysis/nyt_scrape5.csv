" INTERNATIONAL A3-9    North Korea Announces Test of Nuclear Weapon  North Korea said that it had set off its first nuclear test -- just two days after the country was warned by the United Nations Security Council that the action could lead to severe consequences. American officials cautioned that they had not yet received any confirmation that the test had occurred.  A1    The North Korea nuclear test amounted to a major failure for China, which mounted one of its most extensive diplomatic efforts in years to find a negotiated solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis. The Chinese expressed their anger in unusually strong terms, saying the test was ''flagrant and brazen.''  A6    Tsunami Project Stalled  Construction of a road in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, meant as a good-will gesture from the American people to the survivors of the 2004 tsunami, has met with difficulty. Because of long negotiations to acquire right of way through residential and farm land, and through several hundred graves of religious significance, the project has not even started.  A8    Hints at Need for Iraq Change  James A. Baker III, the Republican co-chairman of a panel reassessing Iraq strategy for President Bush, said he expected that the panel would depart from Mr. Bush's repeated calls to ''stay the course,'' and he strongly suggested that the White House enter direct talks with countries it has so far kept at arms length, including Iran and Syria.  A1    American and Iraqi troops fought a fierce battle with militants in the city of Diwaniya, a stronghold of militia members loyal to radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, the American military said. The skirmish was the third serious clash between American or Iraqi soldiers against members of the Mahdi Army in Diwaniya in less than two months.  A8    Japan and China Mend Fences  China and Japan said they had made progress addressing their historical animosities and territorial differences as Shinzo Abe, the new Japanese prime minister, made his first trip to mend ties with Asian neighbors. President Hu Jintao of China, left, called Mr. Abe's visit a turning point for two Asian powers whose relations had sharply declined.  A3    Iran Opposition Cleric Seized  Ayatollah Mohammad Kazemeni Boroujerdi, a senior cleric who opposes clerical rule of Iran, was arrested after clashes with Iranian police officers, news agencies reported. The reports quoted officials as saying that some of the cleric's supporters were armed with knives and daggers and that the police used tear gas to disperse them.  A3    Transponder Not Recalled  The electronic device for broadcasting a plane's identity and altitude carried by the business jet that apparently collided with a Boeing 737 over the Amazon was not one of the potentially faulty ones ordered repaired by American safety officials, the manufacturer said.  A9    NATIONAL A10-15    Religious Employers Enjoy Legal Shield From Lawsuits  Legislators, judges and regulators have carved out or preserved safe havens that shield religious employers of all faiths from most employee lawsuits, from laws protecting pensions and providing unemployment benefits, and from laws that give employees the right to form unions to negotiate with their employers.  A1    Virginia Republicans Resolute  In dozens of interviews in southeastern Virginia, a swing state in tight races for the House and Senate, many conservative Christians said that rather than discourage them from going to the polls, the scandal surrounding Representative Mark Foley only reinforced their reasons to vote for their Republican incumbents.  A1    For all the contradictions and inconsistencies in the tale of Mark Foley, the investigation into how Republicans handled concerns about his conduct may hinge on what transpired in a private meeting that was convened in his office last year.  A12    Races Hinge on Local Economy  Michigan's political races for governor and the Senate are hinging nearly entirely on the struggling economy and the question of who is to blame for it. And in other Rust Belt states, including Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, economic worries are playing a similar role, if a far more subtle one.  A10    Lawyer's Book Causes Trouble  Joyce Dudley, a deputy district attorney in Santa Barbara, published a crime novel. The novel concerns a rape case with echoes of a real one. An appeals court in Ventura, Calif., ruled that Ms. Dudley's novel had crossed an ethical line, and removed her from the case.  A10    Fight Over National Park Hunt  Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, is fighting to preserve an agreement by the National Park Service to close 45,000 acres of parkland on Santa Rosa Island, Calif., to the public for hunting, August through December.  A15    Lettuce Recalled for E. Coli  Less than a week after the Food and Drug Administration lifted its warning on fresh spinach grown in the Salinas Valley, a popular brand of lettuce grown there was recalled over concerns about E. coli contamination. The lettuce does not appear to have caused any illnesses, the president of the grower said.  A10    Senator's Finances Questioned  For the past five years, Senator George Allen, Republican of Virginia, has failed to tell Congress about stock options he received for his work as a director of a high-tech company. Congressional rules require senators to disclose all deferred compensation, like stock options.  A13    NEW YORK/REGION B1-8    Despite Criticism at Home, Giuliani Retains Support  Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, is scheduled to make his first public appearance in two years in New Hampshire. Yet as Mr. Giuliani traverses the country, polls show he has emerged as a leading candidate for the Republican presidential primaries -- largely because of how he guided a wounded city in the weeks after 9/11.  B1    Cluster of Sex Offenders  A house where four sex offenders lived together as roommates has caused an uproar in Suffolk County, where one Suffolk County lawmaker has called for legislation to prevent groups of registered sex offenders from living together.  B1    A Mall of Knockoffs  In the last two years, the city has seized close to $50 million in counterfeit goods from the city's top haven for knockoff and phony goods, and shut down 15 buildings that it claimed were once occupied almost entirely by counterfeiters, but thousands of people still pack the area on weekends.  B1    SPORTSMONDAY D1-10    Steinbrenner Silent on Torre  George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, is fuming over the team's first-round elimination by the Detroit Tigers. He issued a blistering statement through his publicist but took no action on Joe Torre, his manager for the last 11 seasons.  D1    Ugly Finish at Talladega  Brian Vickers won the UAW-Ford 500 at Talladega Superspeedway, after pushing his teammate Jimmie Johnson's car into Dale Earnhardt Jr., on the backstretch of the last lap.  D9    ARTS E1-10    Unlikely Success at Book Fair  A book by the American author Jonathan Littell, ''Les Bienveillantes,'' has taken the Frankfurt fair, the world's largest booksellers' convention, by storm. Written in French, the novel features an unrepentant Nazi SS officer as the hero and could command $1 million, publishers say.  E1    OBITUARIES B9    David G.

" THE NEW TV SEASON -- Three weeks into the new network television season, three new shows are giving early signs of being winners: ''Heroes'' on NBC, ''Jericho'' on CBS and ''Ugly Betty'' on ABC. And some scheduling moves have worked brilliantly, like ABC's shift of ''Grey's Anatomy,'' now television's hottest show'' to Thursday night. But on the down side for the networks, several new shows have already been dropped from schedules and many new series have wasted huge audiences from the hit shows that preceded them. [Page C1.]    A WARNING FOR STUDIOS -- Warner's recent tumble in the studio rankings is a cautionary tale for Hollywood. As the studios begin to shrink their slates and make fewer movies, they are increasing their reliance on the big, expensive extravaganzas. Sometimes they succeed, as ''Batman Begins'' and the ''Harry Potter'' movies have for Warner. But the lackluster results for Warner's blockbusters this summer show that the large tentpole features are not sure things, after all. And when they fail, they put more pressure on smaller films to open big. [C1.]    GUIDING NEW CONSUMERS -- Marketers of all sorts are being urged to give up the steering wheel to a new breed of consumers who want more control over the ways products are peddled to them. Exhortations to bring consumers into the tent dominated an advertising industry conference. Stuart Elliott, Advertising. [C8.]    CONNECTING FAMILIES -- Genealogy sites have long helped their customers reconnect with long-dead ancestors. Now, in keeping with the social networking trend, some sites are trying to connect the living as well. Tim Sullivan, MyFamily's chief executive, left, said that changes at Ancestry.com, had spurred interaction between close and distant relatives by letting them more freely share information about their forebears and post old photos. Bob Tedeschi. E-Commerce Report. [C9.]    A SHIFT AT MICROSOFT -- At Microsoft, the effort to overhaul the Windows operating system was meant to offer a transformation to a new software foundation. But several ambitious initiatives failed to materialize in time, and the project started over from scratch three years ago. The result is more an evolutionary shift, focusing on visual modernization and ease of use. Still, the company is within a month of completing work on new versions of both Windows and Office. [C1.]    OPEC PRODUCTION CUTS -- A consensus among OPEC members began to form over the weekend about cuts in oil production to help stem the recent decline in price, but members have not yet agreed on how to share the reduced output. [C2.]    BROADER DIRECTORY SEARCHES -- Tellme Networks and Cingular Wireless are planning an enhanced 411 information service that will use Tellme's voice recognition technology to begin offering some Internet-style searches in addition to telephone directory information. The new Cingular service will permit subscribers to ask questions for a broader set of queries than traditional directory lookup. Information can be delivered as text-to-speech or as a simple text message delivered to the cellphone. [C8.]    NEW BOOK, LOST JOB -- On Tuesday, Joe Maguire, one of two editors in charge of markets coverage at Reuters, handed his bosses the galleys of his new book, ''Brainless: The Lies and Lunacy of Ann Coulter.'' On Wednesday, Mr. Maguire discovered he would have plenty of free time to promote his book, which comes out this week. Neither side in this dispute would say that he was fired. ''There was a difference of opinion about the approval I received to write this book,'' Mr. Maguire said. [C6.]    QUESTIONS ABOUT POLICY MEETING -- In his new book, ''State of Denial,'' Bob Woodward revealed the presence of journalists, including Fareed Zakaria, the editor of Newsweek International, left, at an otherwise secret meeting Nov. 29, 2001 to discuss Afghanistan and the Middle East in the aftermath of 9/11. The meeting, which included policy makers, Middle East experts and members of influential policy research organizations, was convened by Paul D. Wolfowitz, then the deputy secretary of defense, in an effort to produce a report for President Bush and his cabinet outlining a strategy for the region. Media Talk. [C6.]    TROUBLES AT AIRBUS -- Discussions over who will ultimately make decisions regarding the revamping at Airbus continued over the weekend, and executives close to the talks said Sunday that the chief executive, Christian Streiff, could resign as early as Monday if he did not secure the autonomy that he wanted.

" THE FOLEY SCANDAL    The News -- Speaker J. Dennis Hastert got an endorsement from President Bush as other House Republicans and aides testified about the Mark Foley e-mail scandal.    Behind the News -- Mr. Hastert has been under pressure to resign following revelations that the House leadership had been warned about the behavior of Mr. Foley, a Florida Republican who sent suggestive messages to Congressional pages. But Mr. Bush said the speaker was doing a ''fine job.'' Mr. Hastert himself threatened to fire any aide found to have been involved in a cover-up of the scandal.    THE KOREAN TEST    The News -- Senator John McCain sought to place the blame for North Korea's nuclear test on the policies of former President Bill Clinton.    Behind the News -- The senator's attack was part of an escalating feud as both parties sought to gain political advantage from the crisis. Mr. McCain and other Republicans faulted the Clinton administration for negotiating with North Korea. But Madeleine K. Albright, secretary of state under Mr. Clinton, and others struck back at the Republicans, arguing that President Bush ignored North Korea for too long.    OPEC    The News -- Members of OPEC fought over how to implement a call by the group's current leader, Edmund Daukoru of Nigeria, for cuts in production.    Behind the News -- Faced with oil prices that have fallen by nearly 25 percent in two months, Mr. Daukoru suggested cutting production by a million barrels a day. Many of the 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agree that cuts must be made, but cannot agree on how to apportion them. OPEC's most influential member, Saudi Arabia, has yet to weigh in on the issue.    THE ELECTIONS    The News -- Outside groups are set to unleash a new barrage of negative television advertisements in Congressional races.    Behind the News -- So-called 527 groups can spend nearly unlimited amounts of money on political activities as long as they have not actively coordinated with candidates or parties. And these groups had raised nearly $200 million as of June 30. One group, Americans for Honesty on Issues, led by a Republican consultant from Houston, plans to spend $1 million on ads attacking nine Democratic candidates including Ken Lucas of Kentucky, above.    #%@?/*!    The News -- In her first tour in 12 years, Barbra Streisand returned to the concert stage in her native New York City and promptly gave a heckling fan a piece of her mind.    Behind the News -- The fan was unhappy because part of the concert featured Ms. Streisand, well known for her Democratic leanings, interrogating a George W. Bush impersonator. So Ms. Streisand shut the fan up with an expletive. But the heckler wasn't the only one upset with that part of the act: reviews praised Ms. Streisand's singing but panned the political performance.","https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/weekinreview/the-week-war-of-words-oct-814.html","THE FOLEY SCANDAL    The News -- Speaker J.

TOWARD A BETTER CANAL -- Panamanians will vote in a referendum over whether to add a third set of locks to the Panama Canal (Sunday). The country took over the canal from the United States in 1999, and although there seems to be broad agreement that the project would help bring the outdated canal up to modern standards -- making room for larger ships, for instance, and cutting wait times for vessels lingering offshore -- many Panamanians are skeptical. There is concern, among other things, that the government's $5.2 billion price tag for the seven-year project is a low estimate. Meanwhile, Nicaragua's president has proposed spending $18 billion to build a wider alternative to the Panama Canal.    INDICATORS DU JOUR -- For economic indicators, the focus this week will be on inflation, with the release of the Producer Price Index for September (Tuesday) and the Consumer Price Index for September (Wednesday).

" SIMPSON BOOK -- The publisher of the book from O.J. Simpson, in which he hypothesizes about how he could have committed the 1994 murder of his wife, said that she was told the advance and royalties for the book would go to Mr. Simpson's children, not to him. The publisher, Judith Regan, said she believed the book was ''a confession'' by Mr. Simpson to committing the murders of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. [Page C1]    MILTON FRIEDMAN DIES -- Milton Friedman, the grandmaster of free-market economic theory in the postwar era and a prime force in the movement of nations toward less government and greater reliance on individual responsibility, died in San Francisco, where he lived. Conservative and liberal colleagues alike viewed Mr. Friedman, a Nobel laureate, as one of the 20th century's leading economic scholars. [A1]    INFLATION FALLS AGAIN -- Consumer prices fell 0.5 percent for the second straight month in October, suggesting that inflation was being contained by falling energy prices and a slowing economy. Excluding energy and food, so-called core inflation inched ahead 0.1 percent, the slowest pace since February. [C1]    FURTHER DROP IN OIL -- Oil prices fell to their lowest level in a year as oil traders expressed doubt that OPEC members would carry out their recent deal to trim production. Crude oil for December delivery fell $2.50 a barrel, to settle at $56.26, the steepest in 15 months. [C4]    STOCKS GAIN -- Wall Street scored a fifth straight gain and the Dow Jones industrials achieved their third straight record close. The Dow rose 54.11 points, or 0.44 percent, to 12,305.82. [C9]    DEPARTMENT STORES ON THE RISE -- From the modest cubicles inside Macy's headquarters in Cincinnati to the spacious corner offices at Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, merchants are beginning to discuss something virtually unheard of in the American department store industry: a comeback. After four decades of decline, executives say the department store has again become a destination for shoppers. [A1]    BUSH IN VIETNAM -- President Bush begins a 72-hour visit to Vietnam, linked to an annual Asian summit for which the Communist government in Vietnam is the host. Following Republican losses in Congressional elections and the deteriorating situation in Iraq, White House officials concede the visit is poorly timed. [A12]    ENERGY IN MYANMAR -- In the balmy waters of the Bay of Bengal, just off the coast of Myanmar, an Asian energy rush is on. Huge pockets of natural gas have been found. China and India are jostling to sign deals. Plans are afoot to spend billions on new ports and pipelines. Yet onshore not a light is to be seen. People receive two hours of electricity a day from a military government that is among the world's most repressive. [A1]    MEDIA FIRMS IN PRIVATE HANDS -- Some of the largest broadcasters and publishers are being swept into the arms of private equity firms. The trend could raise new regulatory concerns, however, as some of the big private equity firms start to weave a complex web of cross-ownerships in the industry. The latest example is Clear Channel Communications, which has agreed to be acquired for $18.7 billion by Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital. [C1]    CITIGROUP'S CHINA BANK DEAL -- A group of investors led by Citigroup reached a deal to pay about $3.1 billion for a controlling stake in the Guangdong Development Bank, the first time a foreign-led consortium has won the right to manage a major Chinese bank. The deal came after more than a year of intense negotiation with the Chinese government and a contentious bidding war. [C9]    HEWLETT-PACKARD PROFIT -- In a quarter in which it struggled with revelations about corporate spying, Hewlett-Packard still managed to post sharp gains in profit and revenue. Net income for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Oct. 31 rose 27 percent to $1.7 billion, or 60 cents a share, from adjusted amounts a year earlier. Revenue increased 7 percent. [C4]    ICAHN BID FOR RECKSON -- Days before shareholders of Reckson Associates Realty were scheduled to vote on the company's sale to another publicly traded Midtown office landlord, the investor Carl C. Icahn and the privately held Macklowe Properties have submitted a $4.6 billion offer that tops the earlier bid. [C7]    Business Briefing  Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business.    Jason Calacanis, the outspoken blogger and entrepreneur who ran AOL's Netscape division, resigned yesterday in the wake of the firing of AOL's chief executive, Jonathan Miller. (NYT)    The Starbucks Corporation said that its fourth-quarter profit slipped 5 percent, blaming the dip on new accounting changes. For the 13 weeks that ended Oct. 1, Starbucks, the world's largest specialty coffee retailer, posted net earnings of $117.3 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with $123.7 million, or 16 cents a share, for a year ago. (AP)    Taco Bell will eliminate or reduce trans fats from cooking oils in its American restaurants, the company announced yesterday, making it the latest fast-food chain to do so. Taco Bell, the nation's largest seller of quick-service Mexican-style foods, uses the oils to fry its nachos, taco salad shells, potatoes, chalupa shells and other items. (AP)    Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, said it would begin selling certain generic prescription drugs for $4 in 11 new states, bringing the total to 38 states. Wal-Mart, which started the $4 generic drug program in Florida in September, said it was now available in Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Washington and West Virginia.

A1    Competing to Sway Myanmar  American attempts to pressure Myanmar's government, one of the world's most repressive, to address its people's needs and curb abuses have faltered, in large part, because China's thirst for the country's vast resources has undermined nearly a decade of economic sanctions.  A1    Iraq Seeks Key Sunni's Arrest  The government issued an arrest warrant for Sheik Harith al-Dhari, one of Iraq's most prominent Sunni Arab clerics, on charges of inciting terrorism, officials said.  A14    Sudan Reverses on U.N. Force  The Sudanese government agreed in principle to allow a joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force into the war-stricken Darfur region, reversing its refusal to let any United Nations troops in.

A3    NATIONAL A18-29    Democrats Buck Pelosi Picking New House Leader  House Democrats chose Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland as their new majority leader, rejecting the choice of the incoming speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and straining the unity of the new majority party.  A1    12 Die in Southeast Storm  A volatile storm system killed at least 12 people and injured dozens more across the Southeast before heading north up the Eastern Seaboard, prompting forecasters to issue flash-flood warnings from Virginia to Maine.  A18    Court Denies Blogger's Appeal  A federal appeals court has denied a request for a rehearing from a freelance video journalist and blogger who has been jailed for three months for refusing to cooperate with a grand jury investigation of a violent anticapitalist protest.  A20    Hog Plant Workers Walk Out  In an unusual move by nonunion workers, more than 500 employees walked out at Smithfield Packing's hog-killing plant in Tar Heel, N.C., the largest pork-processing plant in the world. They said they were angry over Smithfield's recent decision to fire dozens of immigrant workers.  A22    SCIENCE/HEALTH    Drug May Increase Endurance  A drug shown to reverse the effects of obesity in mice and make them live longer has now been shown to increase their endurance as well, and may open up a new field of research on similar drugs that may be relevant to the prevention of diabetes and other diseases.  A20    NEW YORK/REGION B1-8    Spitzer Is Said to Favor Removal of Comptroller  Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer is inclined to ask the State Senate to remove Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, who used a state worker as a chauffeur for his ailing wife, people involved in the discussions said. Mr. Spitzer is awaiting the outcome of three separate inquiries into Mr. Hevesi's conduct before he makes a final decision.  A1    Mother Saves Children in Fire  A mother of five helped four of her children escape out of the second-floor window of her burning apartment in Brooklyn, and refused to leave when a fifth child was unable to jump.

" THE INTEREST RATE WATCH The Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board will meet to consider a possible change in interest rates (Tuesday). In recent speeches, Fed governors have said that they remain concerned about inflation, an indication that they may be more inclined to raise rates than to lower them. Most analysts expect the Fed to leave the rate unchanged, but they will be scouring the statement released at the end of the meeting for signs of how the governors view the current state of the economy.    THE INFLATION WATCH Inflation will take center stage when the Labor Department releases the Consumer Price Index for November (Friday). Analysts expect the monthly figure to rise 0.2 percent and the 12-month figure to rise to more than 2.2 percent, a rate above the desired target range of the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.    THE RETAIL SALES WATCH The Commerce Department will release figures on retail sales for November, which will include the start of the holiday shopping season (Wednesday). Analysts expect the figure to rise by 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent. Some big retailers are expected to report quarterly results this week, among them Best Buy and Dollar General (Tuesday) and Costco Wholesale (Thursday).    THE OPEC WATCH The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets to consider a cut in production (Thursday). The price of crude oil has declined about 20 percent since it reached a peak of more than $78 a barrel in mid-July, and the president of OPEC, Edmund Daukoru, left, said last week that he would push for lower output to help support prices.    THE WALL STREET WATCH Wall Street will get a look at its recent performance this week when the Goldman Sachs Group reports quarterly results (Tuesday), followed by Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers (Thursday).    THE CHINA WATCH Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Mr. Bernanke will lead a delegation to China (Thursday).

Homer, an out-of-work director of a local community center in Maine, first heard that NASA was turning to America’s backyard inventors to brainstorm new technologies for a possible return to the moon, he had an idea. With NASA sponsoring seven design contests for everything from a new lunar lander to a new space glove, anybody with a home-brewed invention could enter. Homer’s previous jobs included some gigs in the aerospace industry as well as work sewing boat sails. So, Homer told me not long ago, he ruled out building a flying spacecraft but decided that “the glove contest represented something of the scale I could achieve working out of my home by myself.” He’d always been a garage tinkerer, he said, and being unemployed, he also wanted to prove to his 14-year-old son “that you can do anything if you put your mind to it.” Oh, he added offhandedly, “the money is a motivator, too.” At stake was a prize — presented with one of those giant cardboard checks — for $200,000.",NA,NA,"2007-07-01T04:00:00+0000","nyt://article/af11130a-37a2-5c69-b3d6-67a2c5fa3609",6238,"nyt://article/af11130a-37a2-5c69-b3d6-67a2c5fa3609"

He calls for the United States to produce all electricity from “carbon-free sources” by 2018. This represents quite a shift from his tight focus on the “climate crisis” as the great challenge of our time. The prepared text is below.

""Of the 50 states, Alaska ranks No. 1 in taxes per resident and No. 1 in spending per resident,"" Kinsley writes. ""Its tax burden per resident is 2 1/2 times the national average; its spending, more than double. The trick is that Alaska's government spends money on its own citizens and taxes the rest of us to pay for it."" He continues:    Alaska is, in essence, an adjunct member of OPEC. It has four different taxes on oil, which produce more than 89 percent of the state's unrestricted revenue. On average, three-quarters of the value of a barrel of oil is taken by the state government before that oil is permitted to leave the state. Alaska residents each get a yearly check for about $2,000 from oil revenues, plus an additional $1,200 pushed through by Palin last year to take advantage of rising oil prices. Any sympathy the governor of Alaska expresses for folks in the lower 48 who are suffering from high gas prices or can't afford to heat their homes is strictly crocodile tears.   As if it couldn't support itself, Alaska also ranks No. 1, year after year, in money it sucks in from Washington. In 2005 (the most recent figures), according to the Tax Foundation, Alaska ranked 18th in federal taxes paid per resident ($5,434) but first in federal spending received per resident ($13,950). Its ratio of federal spending received to federal taxes paid ranks third among the 50 states, and in the absolute amount it receives from Washington over and above the amount it sends to Washington, Alaska ranks No. 1.

The American market ended the day down about 3.5%, making it one of the best performers in the world.     4:25 p.m. &#124; A Fall fall: October has one week left after today, and I would not dream of forecasting it. But in the unlikely event that prices do not move from today's closing levels, here is how September-October will rank on the list of worst two-month periods for U.S. stock indexes.  Dow Jones industrials (1920 to 2008)  1. April-May 1932, down 39% 2. March-April 1932, down 31% 3. October-November 1929, down 30% 4. October-November 1987, down 29% 5. August-September 1931, down 29% 6. September-October 1929, down 28% 7. September-October 2008, down 27% 8. November-December 1931, down 26% 9. April-May 1931, down 25% 10. September-October 1987, down 25%  Standard & Poor's 500 (1928-2008) 1. April-May 1932, down 39% 2. September-October 2008, down 32% 3. March-April 1932, down 30% 4. August-September 1931, down 29% 5. October-November 1987, down 28% 6. September-October 1931, down 25% 7. May-June 1932, down 24% 8. April-May 1940, down 24% 9. September-October 1929, down 24% 10. September-October 1987, down 24%   Nasdaq composite (1971-2008) 1. September-October 2008, down 34% 2. February-March 2001, down 34% 3. October-November 1987, down 31% 4. October-November 2000, down 29% 5. September-October 1987, down 29% 6. November-December 2000, down 27% 7. August-September 2001, down 26% 8. April-May 2000, down 26% 9. August-September 1990, down 21% 10. July-August 1998, down 21%   Looking at those lists gives me some comfort. Are these two months really comparable to the Depression periods of 1931 and 1932, or to the crash months of 1929? Will the economy do as badly as it did then? Is the threat to civilization comparable to the spring of 1940, when Germany conquered western Europe? Is the current period really worse for Nasdaq companies than the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 and 2001?  If the answer to those questions is no, then perhaps the selling is overdone.         3:20 p.m. &#124; Gaining Ground: With 40 minutes left, the stock market is near the top of its daily range, with the major indexes down less than 3%. If that holds, it could set a decent tone for the weekend discussions on what else, if anything, authorities should do.  3:15 p.m. &#124; Losing Money in Washington: The head of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation was called to testify before a congressional committee today about the decision to put more of the agency's money into stocks.   As I wrote in August, doing that enabled the agency to assume it would make money in the stocks, and thus get out of the deficit it faced. The explanation for the strategy offered then is memorable:       ""What we're doing here is literally less risky,"" Charles E. F. Millard, the director of the guaranty corporation, told me this week. Or as he put it in an article for Pensions and Benefit Daily, a trade publication, ""The two most important facts about the new investment policy are that it significantly improves the probability the P.B.G.C. will be able to meet its obligations, and that it does so while taking less short-term and long-term risk.""   . . .    Zvi Bodie, a finance professor at Boston University who served as a consultant to the P.B.G.C. and helped write the old policy, says the fundamental flaw in a heavy reliance on stocks is that it is precisely a fall in the value of the American stock market that the agency is insuring against. Not only do pension funds own a lot of stocks — and become more likely to fail if share prices plunge — but the backup guarantee of a pension fund is the value of the equity of the company that established the pension plan.  Mr. Bodie, never one for understatement, compares the P.B.G.C. relying on stocks with an insurance company investing the proceeds from hurricane insurance premiums in Florida real estate.   Today the House Education and Labor Committee released documents showing the agency lost $4.8 billion on stocks in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. You can bet they did not make up those losses this month.  ""With the current market turmoil, we have to ask the question whether it is wise to invest our nation's pension backstop in volatile equities,"" said Representative George Miller, the committee chairman. Where was he when the new policy was being adopted?  Maybe it is too late for the agency to sell a lot of stocks. But Mr. Millard's claims that buying stocks reduced risks seems even less reasonable than it did in August.   2:50 p.m. &#124; Close 'Em Down: Nouriel Roubini, the New York University economist who had sounded warnings for years, suggested at a conference in Madrid today that governments would have to take over more financial institutions and run them, not just invest in them, before this is over.  He also said it might be necessary to close down financial markets for a week, while governments take strong action to restore confidence. I'm not sure why he thinks they can do that; heaven knows they have tried to restore confidence in every way they could think of.    2:05 p.m. &#124; Bail Out: The government-backed takeover of National City, the Cleveland bank, by PNC, calls for shareholders to receive $2.23 per share, well under Thursday's market price of $2.75 and a tenth of what the bank was trading for a year ago.  I don't know if PNC is getting a good or bad deal, but this takeover provides no support for share prices of other troubled banks. At least from this example, the Treasury is not going to allow owners of those banks to be very well treated.  12:45 p.m. &#124; Slipping Back: European markets closed well above their lows, but now the American market is slipping back, with both the Dow and the S.&P, down 4 percent for the day.  It is good to know that some officials have time to worry about other things. Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, has asked a court to enforce ""the president's exclusive right to his image,"" Bloomberg News reports.  The president wants a company to stop selling voodoo kits complete with a Sarkozy doll and needles. ""The unauthorized use of his image on a voodoo doll destined to be pricked with pins cannot be justified,"" says Mr. Sarkozy's lawyer.  If the president wins the suit, the company will have an inventory of voodoo dolls it cannot sell in France. If it decided to export them to this country, they would have to be revamped since Mr. Sarkozy is not that well known (or despised) here.  Let's give the company some help. Whose image would you most like to see on a voodoo doll?    11:42 a.m. &#124; Growls from the Bear Cave: The Jerome Levy Forecasting Center of Mt. Kisco, N.Y., has been among the most worried -- and therefore, most accurate -- forecasters over the past several years.  They are out with a new forecast, which is a combination of ""told ya"" and ""you ain't seen nothing yet.""  Excerpts:     Our view of the next 12 months no longer appears to be unconventional, at least not on the surface. Now everybody thinks the economy is in a recession, and many think it will be long and severe. People make comparisons to the 1930s all the time. Everyone thinks consumer spending is in big trouble. Lots of people think the Fed will ease. Financial instability, a theme we harped on ad nauseam during the past three years, is now the primary economic topic of discussion.     Still, conventional wisdom leaves out much that is important about the economic situation, and it encompasses much that is wrong. . . .     Most investors, businesses and analysts, despite their deep pessimism about the consumer outlook, will be surprised by the length and severity of the consumer pullback.   The public is starting to discover the seriousness of the state and local fiscal position, but the magnitude and fallout of the developing nonfederal government crisis will prove shocking.  Many fear that the present financial mess is setting the stage for surging Treasury yields, and most will be surprised by how low yields will fall. . . .    House prices will probably fall another 20%. . . .   The emerging market sector of the global economy is facing more than a financial crisis; it is facing a depression, which unfortunately is likely to be uncontained and severe in many countries. . . .   Lending is not going to be fixed by recapitalizing banks. The underlying problem is not just that aggregate private loans are too large relative to bank capital; it is that they are too large relative to aggregate private income. Thus, the problem is with the borrowers, not just the lenders, and households need to lower their debt relative to income while corporations need to lower their debt relative to revenue. . .   Even if the recession does end before 2010, employment will continue to decline. It is likely to fall for another year or two as downsizing and restructuring persist. The unemployment rate is likely to reach 8.5% by the end of 2009 and will be near 10% before it reverses.  Let's hope they are wrong this time.   (Note: This item previously said the Levy center was part of Bard College, where Hy Minsky used to teach. That used to be true, but they are no longer connected.)       11:42 a.m. &#124; Rally: The Dow is down less than 200 points for the day, which means it is up 300 points from the low.   11:25 a.m. &#124; Winners and Losers: There are two companies in the S.&P. 100 that are up a bit today, EMC, the storage company, and MasterCard.   The bottom 10 in the group, all down 7 percent or more, are mostly energy or financial companies. (I haven't mentioned today that oil is down despite OPEC's promise to cut production. So is more or less every other commodity.)  They are, from the bottom up, AIG, National Oilwell, Schlumberger, Morgan Stanley, AES, Sprint Nextel, Merrill Lynch, United Health, ConocoPhillips and Weyerhaeuser.     11:15 a.m. &#124; Support?: Markets in Europe and the United States are off their lows, and there does not seem to be panic selling going on. American indexes are down around 4 percent, which is better than Europe or Asia.  11:05 a.m. &#124; Opacity and Worry: A reader asks the following in the comments below:    ""How much further do we have to slide to unwind the derivatives market. Is this essentially the same as your comment on getting hedge funds out?  My reading says that the worse things get for the markets, the bigger the derivatives bubble keeps growing. If all the undercapitalized tranches, CDOs, CDSs, etc. were called today, I understand that the bubble is over $500 trillion. I can't imagine how we get out of that one unless there is a dramatic, unexpected turnaround for God knows what reason in valuations of these assets.""   Those are good questions, and I do not have good answers. The derivatives and hedge fund industries managed to keep so much out of public sight that we now can only guess.  The $500 trillion figure represents notional value, I assume. Such numbers are wildly overstated because many derivatives have maximum losses, or gains, far below the notional value.  Moreover, in the world of derivatives -- unlike the worlds of stocks and bonds and C.D.O.'s -- there are no net losses. Your loss is someone else's profit. But with all the opacity, it is tempting to suspect that everyone is holding losses.   10:50 a.m. &#124; News from the Art World: Sotheby's filed the following with the S.E.C. late yesterday.     ""In October 2008, the Company held an autumn sales series in Hong Kong and a sale of Contemporary Art in London. The aggregate amount of auction guarantees related to property offered at these sales was approximately $60 million. As a result of certain of the guaranteed property failing to sell or selling for less than the minimum guaranteed price, the Company incurred a principal loss of approximately $15 million (pre-tax). The Company will recognize this loss in the third quarter of 2008 as these auction guarantees were outstanding as of September 30, 2008. As a result of the guaranteed property that failed to sell in these auctions, the Company will own inventory currently valued at approximately $11 million, which had an original mid-estimate sale price of approximately $14 million.   Subsequent to the Hong Kong and London sales discussed above and as of October 23, 2008, the Company had outstanding auction guarantees totaling $285.5 million. The Company's financial exposure under these auction guarantees is reduced by $63.3 million as a result of risk sharing arrangements with unaffiliated partners. Substantially all of the property related to such auction guarantees is being offered at auctions in the fourth quarter of 2008. As of October 23, 2008, $81.9 million of the guaranteed amount had been advanced by the Company.   The Company's current financial exposure under auction guarantees represents a 50% reduction from one year ago. In light of the current uncertainty in the global economy and volatility in the financial markets, the Company expects to continue to substantially reduce its use of auction guarantees until stability is restored in the global economy and financial markets.""   Guaranteeing that prices will not fall appears to be a poor decision in almost every market these days.     10:40 a.m. &#124; October Blues: Here are some October performances, through a few minutes ago. In each case, I took a major index from the country in question. All figures are in U.S. dollars.  U.S., down 26% Canada. down 37% Mexico, down 44% Argentina, down 43% Brazil, down 48% Chile, down 30% Peru, down 42%  Britain, down 31% Germany, down 35% France, down 31% Switzerland, down 20% Italy, down 30% Ireland, down 35% Iceland, down 83% Netherlands, down 35% Belgium, down 37% Denmark, down 35% Finland, down 26% Greece, down 45% Poland, down 46% Czech Republic, down 45% Russia, down 53% Hungary, down 50% Lithuania, down 37% Turkey, down 50% South Africa, down 42% Israel, down 22%  Japan, down 23% Hong Kong, down 30% China, down 21% Taiwan, down 23% South Korea, down 46% Australia, down 34% New Zealand, down 25% India, down 36% Singapore, down 35%  The variance is not that great, with the exception of poor Iceland. And remember that prices were way down from last year before October began.  You will note that the United States is among the best performers. Don't you feel better now?                                10:20 a.m. &#124; More Home Sales: The National Association of Realtors announced that existing home sales rose last month. But no one thinks that is good news.  It appears the sales are being driven by desperate sellers, not venturesome buyers. The funny mortgages of yesteryear are forcing people out of their homes.   10:00 a.m. &#124; Why?: Here are two hypotheses on what is happening.  1. The world is finally waking up to just how bad it is, and that earnings are going to fall everywhere. Only a couple of weeks ago, some people were claiming the S.&P. 500 was trading at 12 times the next year's earnings, even if it was around 18 times trailing earnings.   If that is the problem, then this could be nearing an end, and this panic could really mark the bottom. (Fair warning: I've spotted bottoms before during this bust, and been ever so wrong.)  2. This is the hedge fund devastation, as overleveraged hedge funds are forced to sell by falling prices, and then are forced to sell more because they drive prices even lower.   There are rumors around that the Fed is liquidating one hedge fund. There are also denials, so I won't name the fund. But even if the rumor is false, it encapsulates one big worry.  If that is the explanation, this will end when the hedge funds have finally been forced out. Then the rise could be explosive.  Meanwhile, share prices are up from a few minutes ago. Down 324 on the Dow seems like good news.   9:50 a.m. &#124; World Not Over: The Dow is down 400 points now, but is is more or less stable at that level. That is a much smaller loss than they have in Europe and Japan today. Is there buying support coming in? We can hope.   9:40 a.m. &#124; Rate Cuts Coming?: Will central banks cut rates again? The lead, if it is to happen, needs to come from the places where rates are highest, in Europe. It is midafternoon in London and Frankfurt.   That is one obvious thing to try. But everyone knows that central bank easing is not spreading to those who need credit the most. How reassuring would it be.    9:28 a.m. &#124; Circuit Breakers: Not to seem negative, but here is what it would take to halt the stock exchange after it opens. These are the current version of the circuit breaker rules that were passed after the 1987 crash.  A 1,100-point drop in the DJIA before 2 p.m. would halt trading for one hour. The halt would be 30 minutes if the number were hit between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. After that, 1,100 points would not be enough to halt trading.  A 2,200-point drop in the DJIA before 1 p.m. will halt trading for two hours. It would halt trading for one hour if it came between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., and would end trading for the day if it came after 2 p.m.  A 3,350-point drop would halt trading for the remainder of the day, no matter when it happened.  9:15 a.m. &#124; General Electric Seeks Cash: It was yesterday that General Electric said it would borrow through the Federal Reserve's new credit facility when it opens for business next week.  Bloomberg quotes a G.E. spokesman as follows: ""This is our way to demonstrate our support for what the Fed is doing, which is providing all around liquidity.""  He may have had it backwards. This is the Fed supporting companies. It would have been more reassuring if mighty G.E. were confident it did not need government support to borrow money.    9:05 a.m. &#124; British Recession:The rout was already under way when Britain announced today that its economy was shrinking during the third quarter of the year, so we can't blame this on the Brits.  Nonetheless, the fact the decline in G.D.P. was worse than expected helped to set the tone.  One part of the problem became clear when Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the exchequer -- Britain's fancy name for finance minister -- spoke to a television interviewer for Sky News.  ""We are determined to do everything we can and as soon as we can to help people,"" he said. ""We've got to work together. The credit crunch is global.""  You will note that he did not mention anything in specific that they would do. I doubt he has much idea of what he can do.    8:55 a.m. &#124; U.N. Day: The world's markets are quaking more than I have ever seen today. Stock index futures stopped trading in the United States this morning, after they fell the daily limit for overnight trading. That is 550 points for the Dow futures, and 60 for the S.&P. futures.  The New York Stock Exchange has just said it will open for trading at 9:30 a.m., as scheduled. The fact they think it is necessary to say that is hardly encouraging.  Around the world, already low share prices have been hammered. Japan was especially hard hit, as Toyota announced sales were down and other exporters said they were running into problems as well.  What is most scary about this is that it comes after the major industrial countries pulled out all the stops to try to bail out banks and get their financial systems running again. What more tricks do they have available?  Today is the 63rd anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. That date used to be celebrated. If we had made it a holiday around the world, as some advocated, at least this would not be happening today.  As it is, the date seems somehow appropriate. It was not that long ago that many were confident about ""decoupling,"" in which the United States could falter but the rest of the world's economies, particularly those in developing countries, could keep humming along.   Now it is clear we are all in this together.   ",NA,NA,"2008-10-24T12:52:32+0000","nyt://article/77be58b7-ef23-5add-9b9d-249eecd6d184",3425,"nyt://article/77be58b7-ef23-5add-9b9d-249eecd6d184"

This is professional hockey in Russia now, at its best. And across the land of the old Soviet sports machine, whether the place is a rink, soccer pitch or basketball court, the scene repeats itself: few countries better reflect the newest face of globalization in sports. In Russia, foreigners round out the pro teams  legionery, legionnaires, they call them, with a mix of awe and disdain. In Omsk, the transcontinental gap matters little. With more than 10,000 fans screaming at the top of their lungs, communication is rendered moot. As the final seconds tick by, and both clubs express a level of hustle, stick work and hunger worthy of any match in North America, one man towers above all others: Jaromir Jagr. In Omsk, a black-collar city of 1.2 million souls, where the oil flares burn all night, marking the edge of town and the promise of the future, Jagr, the superstar who until midsummer reigned as the captain of the New York Rangers and a winner of nearly every trophy in the National Hockey League, now rules what he calls “the big ice.”","MM","42","2008-10-27T22:23:49+0000","nyt://article/a9498cb3-ea41-50a6-aaee-616e8811cc2c",5393,"nyt://article/a9498cb3-ea41-50a6-aaee-616e8811cc2c"

"Gore takes his climate prescription back to the Senate.","https://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/blogs/28dotearth-gore-res669.html","Gore takes his climate prescription back to the Senate.","WASHINGTON - Former Vice President Al Gore was back on Capitol Hill on Wednesday with a new set of scary slides dramatizing the heating of the planet and urging lawmakers to act quickly on President Obama's stimulus package, which contains billions of dollars in alternative energy investments.  Mr. Gore, the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee and co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on climate change, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the new spending Mr. Obama is proposing will begin to quickly reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants blamed for global warming.  ""The plan's unprecedented and critical investments in four key areas -– energy efficiency, renewables, a unified national energy smart grid and the move to clean cars –- represent an important down payment and are long overdue,"" Mr. Gore said. ""These crucial investments will create millions of new jobs and hasten our economic recovery, while strengthening our national security and beginning to solve the climate crisis.""  He called the short-term investments a prelude to the larger task of placing a price on carbon to discourage its use as an energy source, either through a direct tax or a cap-and-trade system or both.   In Mr. Gore's last appearance before Congress, in March 2007, his pleas were well-received by some lawmakers and scoffed at by others. The Bush administration largely ignored his warnings of a ""planetary emergency"" and pursued a less urgent approach to climate issues.  But on Wednesday, Mr. Gore served essentially as a cheerleader and lobbyist for Mr. Obama, who has consulted him on environmental and energy issues and named several of his former aides to top policymaking positions. Mr. Gore was gently challenged by some Republican members of the committee who wanted him to endorse nuclear power as a clean alternative to coal and to endorse returning to the public all revenues from a carbon reduction regime.  Mr. Gore and Mr. Obama want Congress to act this year on a cap-and-trade system to control greenhouse gases through a permitting system to demonstrate American seriousness on the issue in advance of talks in Copenhagen in December on a new international climate change treaty.  ""A fair, effective and balanced treaty will put in place the global architecture that will place the world –- at long last and in the nick of time – on a path toward solving the climate crisis and securing the future of human civilization,"" Mr. Gore told the panel.  For those who want more detail, here's the prepared text of Mr. Gore's testimony:     Statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee As Prepared Hon. Al Gore Wednesday, January 28, 2009  We are here today to talk about how we as Americans and how the United States of America as part of the global community should address the dangerous and growing threat of the climate crisis. We have arrived at a moment of decision. Our home – Earth – is in grave danger. What is at risk of being destroyed is not the planet itself, of course, but the conditions that have made it hospitable for human beings.  Moreover, we must face up to this urgent and unprecedented threat to the existence of our civilization at a time when our country must simultaneously solve two other worsening crises. Our economy is in its deepest recession since the 1930s. And our national security is endangered by a vicious terrorist network and the complex challenge of ending the war in Iraq honorably while winning the military and political struggle in Afghanistan. As we search for solutions to all three of these challenges, it is becoming clearer that they are linked by a common thread – our dangerous over-reliance on carbon-based fuels.  As long as we continue to send hundreds of billions of dollars for foreign oil – year after year – to the most dangerous and unstable regions of the world, our national security will continue to be at risk.  As long as we continue to allow our economy to remain shackled to the OPEC rollercoaster of rising and falling oil prices, our jobs and our way of life will remain at risk. Moreover, as the demand for oil worldwide grows rapidly over the longer term, even as the rate of new discoveries is falling, it is increasingly obvious that the roller coaster is headed for a crash. And we're in the front car.  Most importantly, as long as we continue to depend on dirty fossil fuels like coal and oil to meet our energy needs, and dump 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the thin shell of atmosphere surrounding our planet, we move closer and closer to several dangerous tipping points which scientists have repeatedly warned – again just yesterday – will threaten to make it impossible for us to avoid irretrievable destruction of the conditions that make human civilization possible on this planet. We're borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet. Every bit of that's got to change.  For years our efforts to address the growing climate crisis have been undermined by the idea that we must choose between our planet and our way of life; between our moral duty and our economic well being. These are false choices. In fact, the solutions to the climate crisis are the very same solutions that will address our economic and national security crises as well.  In order to repower our economy, restore American economic and moral leadership in the world and regain control of our destiny, we must take bold action now.  The first step is already before us. I urge this Congress to quickly pass the entirety of President Obama's Recovery package. The plan's unprecedented and critical investments in four key areas – energy efficiency, renewables, a unified national energy grid and the move to clean cars – represent an important down payment and are long overdue. These crucial investments will create millions of new jobs and hasten our economic recovery – while strengthening our national security and beginning to solve the climate crisis.  Quickly building our capacity to generate clean electricity will lay the groundwork for the next major step needed: placing a price on carbon. If Congress acts right away to pass President Obama's Recovery package and then takes decisive action this year to institute a cap-and-trade system for CO2 emissions – as many of our states and many other countries have already done – the United States will regain its credibility and enter the Copenhagen treaty talks with a renewed authority to lead the world in shaping a fair and effective treaty. And this treaty must be negotiated this year. Not next year. This year.  A fair, effective and balanced treaty will put in place the global architecture that will place the world – at long last and in the nick of time – on a path toward solving the climate crisis and securing the future of human civilization. I am hopeful that this can be achieved. Let me outline for you the basis for the hope and optimism that I feel.  The Obama Administration has already signaled a strong willingness to regain U.S. leadership on the global stage in the treaty talks, reversing years of inaction. This is critical to success in Copenhagen and is clearly a top priority of the administration.  Developing countries that were once reluctant to join in the first phases of a global response to the climate crisis have themselves now become leaders in demanding action and in taking bold steps on their own initiatives. Brazil has proposed an impressive new plan to halt the destructive deforestation in that nation. Indonesia has emerged as a new constructive force in the talks. And China's leaders have gained a strong understanding of the need for action and have already begun important new initiatives. Heads of state from around the world have begun to personally engage on this issue and forward-thinking corporate leaders have made this a top priority.  More and more Americans are paying attention to the new evidence and fresh warnings from scientists. There is a much broader consensus on the need for action than there was when President George H.W. Bush negotiated – and the Senate ratified – the Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 and much stronger support for action than when we completed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997.  The elements that I believe are key to a successful agreement in Copenhagen include: • Strong targets and timetables from industrialized countries and differentiated but binding commitments from developing countries that put the entire world under a system with one commitment: to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other global warming pollutants that cause the climate crisis; • The inclusion of deforestation, which alone accounts for twenty percent of the emissions that cause global warming; • The addition of sinks including those from soils, principally from farmlands and grazing lands with appropriate methodologies and accounting. Farmers and ranchers in the U.S. and around the world need to know that they can be part of the solution; • The assurance that developing countries will have access to mechanisms and resources that will help them adapt to the worst impacts of the climate crisis and technologies to solve the problem; and, • A strong compliance and verification regime.  The road to Copenhagen is not easy, but we have traversed this ground before. We have negotiated the Montreal Protocol, a treaty to protect the ozone layer, and strengthened it to the point where we have banned most of the major substances that create the ozone hole over Antarctica. And we did it with bipartisan support. President Ronald Reagan and Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill joined hands to lead the way.  Let me now briefly discuss in more detail why we must do all of this within the next year, and with your permission Mr. Chairman, I would like to show a few new pictures that illustrate the unprecedented need for bold and speedy action this year.  Thank you Mr. Chairman. I am eager to respond to any questions that you and the members of the committee have.

"Much of the carnage in Mexico, it turns out, is evidence that these so-called drug ""cartels"" are not really cartels, in the economic sense of the word.","https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/21/blogs/21economix-drug-war32021.html","Much of the carnage in Mexico, it turns out, is evidence that these so-called drug ""cartels"" are not really cartels, in the economic sense of the word.","Mexico's drug cartels are many things: murderous, dangerous and remarkably effective at smuggling huge quantities of illegal drugs into the United States. But are they really cartels? Cartels are organizations that control prices and production. They often divide territories, rig bids and engage in other collusive acts. On the international relations front, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is the most famous example. Mexico's drug cartels grab far more headlines than OPEC these days, with their bloody executions, their buying off of police officers and politicians, and their roles as global producers and suppliers of heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana and as traffickers of cocaine. Much of the carnage in Mexico, it turns out, is evidence that these so-called cartels are not really cartels, in an economic sense of the word. Whatever cooperation these cartels once had has now largely broken down. Inter- and intra-cartel violence is responsible for the vast majority of the drug-related murders in the country, law enforcement officials in Mexico and the United States maintain. Pick a violent city in Mexico, whether it is Ciudad Juarez or Tijuana or Culiacan, and there is inevitably one cartel battling another for control of the ""plaza,"" which is the local term for turf or trafficking route. In many cases, cartels have split, with rivals battling for control. Each of them is made up differently, experts say, some with semi-independent cells and others with top-down leadership structures. Some of those following Mexico's cartels -- which include the Tijuana Cartel, the Sinaloa Cartel, the Gulf Cartel and the Beltran Leyva Cartel, among others - have begun acknowledging that the cartels are something else entirely. ""The term drug cartel is inaccurate and improperly used by media, based exclusively on strict economic fundamental theory,'' Rodolfo Sosa-Garcia, a Mexican economist at Galilei Consulting, wrote me recently. He urged reporters to pick a more accurate term, like ""narco-producer,'' which he said would prompt governments and international financial institutions to follow suit. The Congressional Research Service, in a report on Mexico released last week in Washington, remarked: ""The term drug cartel remains the term used colloquially and in the press, but some experts disagree with this because 'cartel' often refers to price-setting groups and it is not clear that Mexican drug cartels are setting illegal drug prices.'' Most trace the use of the term to Colombia, where the two main drug cartels were named after the cities in which they operated, Cali and Medellin. George W. Grayson, a professor at the College of William &#38; Mary in Virginia who follows Mexico's drug war, said the term made some sense in Mexico in the 1970s when Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, who was known as The Godfather, ruled the drug world in the Mexican state of Sinaloa, without considerable opposition. Mr. Felix Gallardo was jailed in 1989 and he began doling out his turf from behind bars, resulting in a fragmentation in what had been a cohesive cartel.",NA,NA,"2009-09-21T14:20:51+0000","nyt://article/877efab2-2a6e-543a-ba28-9f2c2e710abb",490,"nyt://article/877efab2-2a6e-543a-ba28-9f2c2e710abb"

More than 30 countries, including the United States, have now detected the variant. But it is still unclear how contagious, dangerous and resistant to vaccines it may be. President Biden on Thursday extended a requirement for travelers to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses until mid-March and introduced a new requirement that international travelers be tested for the coronavirus one day before departing for the United States. After oil prices collapsed when reports of Omicron first emerged, OPEC Plus, a group of oil-producing countries that includes Russia, decided to stay on course with its plans to increase production — but said its meeting would “remain in session” in case adjustments were required. John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that the variant could prolong the supply chain problems that have caused persistently high inflation. And one investment manager said of Omicron’s impact on the economy: “I think it’s just guesswork, for anybody.

The decision caught everyone off guard because in the days leading up to the announcement, officials said they did not intend to make changes to their policies. There are a few possible factors behind the cuts: Both Russia and Saudi Arabia have been struggling to keep up with production, according to recent reports. And OPEC Plus could be responding to the darkening economic outlook, made dimmer by the failure of several banks. OPEC Plus’s changes to oil production may ultimately have limited effect.
