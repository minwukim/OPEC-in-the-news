With double‐digit inflation hand, the Administration now wants to err on the side of recession rather than “risk” a continuation of unexpectedly rapid growth.","A","26","1979-04-13T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/720a1ee7-1771-5e32-854e-755b328f91a8",671,"nyt://article/720a1ee7-1771-5e32-854e-755b328f91a8"

It is called energy efficiency.","SM","12","1979-09-23T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/d1408655-d1fa-572e-b367-10c5c96aaa40",4283,"nyt://article/d1408655-d1fa-572e-b367-10c5c96aaa40"

Its gross national product for the year that ends 1 tomorrow is more than 50 percent greater than that of the Soviet Union and more than double that of Japan, its nearest rivals; its consumers were able to buy $1.5 trillion worth of products, by far the highest figure for any nation. As America enters the 80's. it is still outproducing and outconsuming all other industrial economies. But at some juncture during the past decade —precisely when is difficult to pinpoint — signs of deep and continuing trouble began to appear. The country's rate of production began to decline; it slipped from being No. 1 in the world to No. 7 in per capita G.N.P. — that is in the amount it produced per person; the value of the dollar plunged on world markets, and inflation began to erode severely the abilities of Americans to support themselves and their families. With doubts growing day by day, some believe we could well be entering a dangerous world crisis whose roots are essentially economic. For this reason, a continued failure to solve our economic problems may herald far more than downward adjustments in living standards. No one needs to be reminded that economic chaos gave rise to Hitler and ultimately World War II.","SM","3","1979-12-30T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/e323068d-f26a-5a2c-bcce-cf6a1cc7b68b",5576,"nyt://article/e323068d-f26a-5a2c-bcce-cf6a1cc7b68b"

The argument advanced by The Times rests strongly on the proposition that those who have focused on our balance-of-trade deficits in current dollars have misled us into thinking the problem more serious than it is.

It is a shame, however, that the article's presentation of the position of the developing countries was so distorted.   he developing countries have put forth a comprehensive set of proposals for changes in existing international economic and political institutions and practices.

Chief among these problems is one that is shared by most other industrial countries - the persistence of large wage and price increases, even in the face of high unemployment and slack production. This problem poses the single most important challenge to U.S. economic policy - reducing inflation while maintaining a reasonably prosperous and growing economy.   While the magnitude of these economic challenges is cause for serious concern, it does not warrant pessimism. During the 1970's the U.S. economy performed quite well in many important respects.  Over that decade our country outperformed most other major countries in providing jobs for its people. Employment grew almost 25 percent as the American economy created jobs not only for millions of youths entering the labor market for the first time but also for millions of women, who found job opportunities in growing numbers. This performance continued through the last years of the decade at an increased pace. While the growth in the number of employed persons was temporarily interrupted by the recession of 1980, the basic performance was virtually unparalleled.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/18/us/excerpts-from-annual-report-of-the-president-s-council-of-economic.html","","Following are excerpts from Chapter 1 of the Annual Report of the Council of Economic Advisers, released today: In the 1980's, the United States will confront a variety of stubborn problems that have developed during the past 15 years.

Yet American consumers were given false signals by prices that, in effect, ''lied'' about the relationship of the domestic market to the world market.

Most modern boats are built fiber-glass layers bonded together with polyester resin, and the resin is an oil-derivative whose cost has skyrocketed in recent years. Because 50 to 70 percent of a boat hull is resin, the cost of traditionally constructed boats has soared dramatically. This is one reason why designers and builders have started producing boats that are much lighter and simpler.

Another reason for the current trend toward lightness and simplicity has to do with recent developments in the yacht-racing world. Boats designed to the International Offshore Rule (IOR) have become increasingly sophisticated and expensive. As a result, many racing sailors have grown dischanted with the IOR.

"  Ronald Reagan is being inaugurated as the 40th President of the United States for one reason above all others - because high inflation and interest rates and continuing unemployment convinced the public that his economic promises offered more hope than Jimmy Carter's discredited policies.   If that is so, then the primary standard by which Mr. Reagan should be judged in the coming years is his success or lack of it in righting the economy - most particularly in bringing down the rate of price increases.   Conservatives will of course protest, properly, that there were other causes for Mr. Reagan's electoral college landslide.

"  4,747 words Tom Wicker writes The New York Times's ''In the Nation'' column twice weekly. By Tom Wicker Campaigning for re-election last year in a South Dakota supermarket, George S. McGovern met two elderly women who said they would vote against him because he was too liberal. Then he watched them pay for their groceries with food stamps - the fruits of a liberal Democratic program that no one had supported more vigorously than he.   That told him, the former Senator says, that his re-election campaign was lost. And all too many other voters in 1980 seemed as willing to forget or overlook years of Democratic programs that have helped people with everything from medical problems to home mortgages. When the smoke of election cleared, the party had lost the Presidency, 12 Senate seats - including Mr. McGovern's - 33 House seats, four governorships and 220 state legislative posts.   Now, with Ronald Reagan in the White House, the Republicans controlling the Senate and the conservative movement having won its chance to reshape the country, the Democrats are, in the words of Scott Matheson, the Democratic Governor of Utah, ''a disheveled lot.'' Their basic approach - big and costly Government programs of benevolent intent but mixed results - has fallen into disrepute with inflation-conscious voters. Little is agreed upon to replace or supplement that approach, which goes back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the party's organization is almost nonexistent.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/magazine/democrats-in-search-of-ideas.html","","4,747 words Tom Wicker writes The New York Times's ''In the Nation'' column twice weekly.

"  STAMFORD IS there coal in Connecticut's future? ''There are the coal dealers who are advocating that we use coal in the abundance that Mother Nature created it, and environmental groups who say that coal should not be used at all,'' said Leonard Bruckman, director of the division of air compliance in the State Department of Environmental Protection.   ''Hopefully, there is a middle ground that we can achieve,'' the official said.  In pursuing what it regards as a middle course between the extreme views of industry and environmentalists, the evironmental-protection department is preparing to recommend that a key pollution control standard be eased. A change in the standard, governing sulfur content, would appear open the way to a substantial amount of industrial coal burning. At the same time, at least one major utility is planning to switch from oil to coal for some of its needs.   And while government agencies are feeling increased pressure from coal companies and utilities to reduce some of the pollution control laws, many homeowners are seeking to reduce their own energy costs by installing variations of the pot-bellied stoves that heated homes in this country for generations.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/nyregion/softening-of-restrictions-on-coal-use-may-be-sought.html","","STAMFORD IS there coal in Connecticut's future?

''Interest rates are always important, but they were overwhelmingly the tail that wagged the dog last year,'' Alan Teck, a vice president of the Chemical Bank, said.

Indeed, the agility of investors to shift from one currency to another to take advantage of higher interest rates in each particular country has, in some cases, analysts say, obscured the fundamental underpinning of a currency's value.

In such an environment, the direction of currency values has become harder to predict, and analysts' opinions vary.

New York's pioneering energy-audit program was early to recognize the positive advantages of electric and gas utilities as full participants in efforts to increase energy efficiency within the state.

"  NOW that the Reagan Administration has decontrolled oil prices, it has begun to consider the more politically troublesome and economically volatile issue of natural gas deregulation. Even though candidate Reagan campaigned on a platform calling for immediate decontrol of natural gas prices, it is becoming more and more likely that President Reagan will not ask Congress to vote on the issue.  Instead, he will probably embark on what some have called ''the backdoor approach'' to decontrol, an approach that requires no legislated change in the current law, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.   Through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which administers the gas act, the Administration can raise the average price for all gas by allowing dramatic increases in the price for certain categories of gas. It was precisely this path that David Stockman laid out to a gas industry meeting before he became director of the Office of Management and Budget.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/22/business/comment-backdoor-decontrol.html","","NOW that the Reagan Administration has decontrolled oil prices, it has begun to consider the more politically troublesome and economically volatile issue of natural gas deregulation.

The decline, which accompanied sizable price advances resulting from decontrol and from the latest round of increases by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has left imports for the last four weeks at just over 5.8 million barrels a day, the lowest average for such a period since June 1975.

Others, however, are appalled by what they regard as dangerous complacency about energy supplies when there is a chance for the first time in several years to do something significant to improve supplies.

But for the long suffering American motorist, his psyche scarred in recent years by periodic shortages and relentless price increases, it's welcome relief indeed.   All over the country, gas stations in the last few weeks have been shaving prices in response to what almost everybody but oil executives is calling a glut. The outlook for the summer driving season, barring a major supply interruption, hasn't been so bright in years. Although there's little reason to expect that prices will drop substantially, there are signs at least that the upward spiral has stalled for now.   The softening, while limited, stands in contrast to the sharp jump in prices during the first quarter. President Reagan's decontrol of domestic crude oil prices added perhaps 10 cents a gallon to the price of gasoline this year. Increases from a price rise in December by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries contributed a similar amount, and several states are pushing the price up by increasing gas taxes.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/business/why-gasoline-is-getting-cheaper.html","","IT may not be like the glorious 60's, when a driver could buy a half tank of gasoline for pocket money, with balloons, beer mugs or soda pop thrown in.

Few bankers or economists doubt that there will be a rebound in German business activity in the first half of 1982. But they say there are indications that the nation's business foundations have been severely damaged, bringing a sense of fragility to Germany's image as a resourceful, resilient economic power.   The country's current economic problems are the result, at least in part, of higher oil prices. But there are other, more troubling, aspects that portend longer-term ills.

"  The current worldwide abundance of crude oil, coupled with improved conservation of petroleum in the industrialized nations, is strengthening the American economy, according to economists and business leaders. This is in sharp contrast to the problems that oil brought to Western economies after the Iranian revolution two and a half years ago.   Bulging worldwide oil inventories are 400 million barrels greater than normal, spot prices have slipped by more than $2 a barrel and expectations are rising that oil prices will decline or remain stable for the rest of the year.   Government statistics show that the abundance of oil is already slowing inflation, aiding economic growth and cutting the United States trade deficit to the slimmest total in more than five years.   These economic gains are also strengthening the dollar, which is approaching its record high levels of the early 1970's on the world's foreign exchange markets.

"  More Japanese Concessions   Japan's Prime Minister, Zenko Suzuki, having agreed to limit auto exports to the United States, meets this week with President Reagan to discuss additional ways to promote economic cooperation.   Trade experts expect the Japanese leader to agree to a unilateral reduction in tariffs on semiconductor imports from the United States, and they predict an official advisory panel will be established to consider long-term trends in the economic relationship. However, U.S. requests for increased defense appropriations are likely to be resisted; instead, the Japanese may counter with offers of more economic assistance to the Middle East and the Caribbean, easing U.S. burdens in those areas.   Not all is sweetness and light, however. Trade concessions may have hurt the Prime Minister politically, analysts say. With cabinet changes due in the fall, an increasingly tough stance toward the U.S. seems possible.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/03/business/prospects.html","","More Japanese Concessions","3","1","1981-05-03T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/d3ad4eea-2eda-5d97-863a-b25867b1e571",737,"nyt://article/d3ad4eea-2eda-5d97-863a-b25867b1e571"
"According to the Reagan Administration, the economic problems of the United States have been caused by a group of eager but misguided liberal Democratic beavers. They created a dam out of the sticks of high tax rates and the mud of social-welfare spending and stopped the stream of economic progress. If this dam were simply ripped out, Washington's new reigning economists say, there would be an initial surge in the stream of economic activity as all of that pent-up energy is released. And then the stream would resume its normal, rapidly flowing course.

The stream clearly needs to be dredged of its impediments. The growth of productivity (output per hour of work) declined from 3 percent prior to 1965 to 1 percent in 1976, and since 1977, it has fallen to -.5 percent. Only in the fourth quarter of 1980 - after cor-recting for inflation - did the Gross National Product regain the level it had achieved in the first quarter of 1979, when it reached $2,732 billion. Inflation has been erratically accelerating from less than 2 percent in 1965 to more than 12 percent in 1980. Unemployment has risen from 3.5 percent in 1969 to 7.5 percent today.

These problems have been a long time in the making and have worsened right through both Democratic and Republican Presidencies.

"  To the Editor:    What welcome news it was to learn that New York City has a $243-million budget surplus, and how ironic it was to get that news just two days after The Times published a letter (May 9) in which Manhattan Borough President Andrew Stein ranted about Con Edison's rates.   One of two things lies at the heart of Mr. Stein's letter: extraordinary naivete or extreme callousness toward the consumers he claims he wishes to protect. Here's why:   Fact: From 1970 to 1980, annual taxes paid by city residents to the city through their Con Edison bills soared by $324 million, to $537 million from $213 million. Meanwhile, customers used only slightly more electricity in 1980 than they did in 1970. In other words, the increase in city taxes levied through Con Edison bills is greater than the budget surplus.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/15/opinion/l-the-politicos-contribution-to-electric-rates-120679.html","","To the Editor:","A","30","1981-05-15T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/b2b95ac8-2013-5733-ba68-af4cc710313d",492,"nyt://article/b2b95ac8-2013-5733-ba68-af4cc710313d"

"  When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in Geneva next week, the cartel will face its toughest challenge since it began dictating oil prices eight years ago.  Slackening world demand, growing supplies of oil from other sources and a propensity to convert to other forms of energy have reduced the need for OPEC oil to its lowest level in years.   Oil consumption in the non-Communist world in the second quarter of this year will average 46.1 million barrels per day, a substantial drop from 49.4 million barrels per day in 1980, the International Energy Agency in Paris estimates.   For the moment, OPEC has been able to step around the crisis by accepting production cuts among the highest-priced producers, those in Africa. But the organization's difficulties appear likely to extend well into the future. Most of the factors that led to the excess are expected to grow, straining OPEC's future ability to set prices unilaterally.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/17/weekinreview/it-s-opec-s-turn-to-worry-over-oil-supplies.html","","When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in Geneva next week, the cartel will face its toughest challenge since it began dictating oil prices eight years ago.

Nor is the pricing history of this commodity, even pre-OPEC, a cause for much celebration.   But the optimists do have some strong arguments: Demand for petroleum products in the industrialized world is plummeting, the world oil market is soggy with excess supplies, and the most significant OPEC member, Saudi Arabia, is running its wells at unusually high levels, aiming at freezing prices or even forcing them lower.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/24/business/a-rosy-outlook-for-oil-but-cross-your-fingers.html","","A S the oil ministers' customized jets swoop toward Geneva for the mid-year meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that begins tomorrow, a consensus has taken shape among Western economists, oil analysts and government policymakers that the cartel has never been in shakier shape.","3","6","1981-05-24T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/1d282fe4-ad78-5f03-910a-db79a313c1b6",1899,"nyt://article/1d282fe4-ad78-5f03-910a-db79a313c1b6"

Suggesting the former view was Saudi Arabia's refusal yesterday to raise its crude oil prices to the level of other OPEC members or to cut its huge production, as most other OPEC nations will do on June 1. The Saudi attitude seems likely to guarantee a continuation of the oil glut that has aided industrial nations' economies by putting downward pressure on oil prices.

The 10 percent cutback agreed to by most OPEC nations will probably not total more than 1.5 billion barrels a day, well below the world oversupply of 2 to 3 million barrels daily - an excess that Saudi Arabia could easily dry up by reducing its current production of 10.3 million barrels daily, more than 40 percent of all OPEC output.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/27/business/complex-motives-by-saudis-indicated.html","","Is Saudi Arabia the altruist of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, putting the interests of the Western world at the forefront of its considerations?

H.E. Dr. Subroto, Minister of Mines and Energy of Indonesia and president of the 59th meeting of the conference, formally opened the conference by expressing, on behalf of their excellencies the heads of delegation and all delegates, the profound grief and shock felt on the sad occasion of the tragic death of H.E.  Dr. Jaime Roldos-Aguilera, president of Ecuador, his wife, and a number of high-ranking officers of his Cabinet.   The conference unanimously re-elected as its president H.E. Dr.  Subroto. H.E. Mallam Yahaya Dikko, presidential adviser on petroleum and energy of Nigeria and head of its delegation, was unanimously elected alternate president.   The conference decided to entrust the Long-Term Strategy Committee, under the chairmanship of H.E.

"  Faced with Saudi Arabia's refusal to increase its oil prices or cut back its huge production, the other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided tonight to freeze prices at current levels and to cut production to reduce the world's oversupply of oil.   The price freeze, announced in a communique at the end of a two-day meeting of OPEC oil ministers, means that the 12 Text of OPEC communique, page D13. OPEC member nations other than Saudi Arabia will hold their oil prices at the current level of $36 to $41 a barrel until the next pricing meeting, in December.   As for Saudi Arabia, Abdul Aziz al-Turki, the deputy petroleum minister, told reporters that the world's biggest oil-exporting nation would remain firm at its $32-a-barrel level for its light Arabian crude, its main grade of oil.   ''We have tried to reach a unified price and in the absence of a unified price, we are going to stay at $32,'' Mr. Turki said of his country's efforts in recent weeks to get OPEC agreement for a basic price of about $34 a barrel - a move that would have required the Saudis to raise their price and the other OPEC members to drop theirs. In the past, however, Saudi officials have often made similar statements in the heat of an OPEC meeting only to reverse them a short while later and raise prices.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/27/business/opec-nations-freeze-oil-prices-and-agree-on-production-cuts.html","","Faced with Saudi Arabia's refusal to increase its oil prices or cut back its huge production, the other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided tonight to freeze prices at current levels and to cut production to reduce the world's oversupply of oil.","A","1","1981-05-27T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/f324ce0e-8322-5469-b877-db431431bf01",1357,"nyt://article/f324ce0e-8322-5469-b877-db431431bf01"
"  The semiannual meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries adjourned last night, but the final communique may not have been the last word.   Among the questions it left unanswered were: Will Saudi Arabia, now charging $32 a barrel for its principal grade of oil, raise prices to the other countries' $36 level and reduce production? Will the production quotas adopted here by other members push prices up in a market that appears to be pushing them relentlessly down?   For some, the meeting also left questions about OPEC's cohesiveness.  Amid such uncertainties, quick judgments are highly speculative.  But the prevailing view in the halls of the InterContinental Hotel here among ministers and onlookers was that the Saudis would move within a few months to raise prices and reduce production. And the agreement whereby most of the 12 other OPEC members will cut production 10 percent was viewed as an important precedent, although too vague to have a substantial impact.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/28/business/opec-meeting-leaves-many-questions-news-analysis.html","","The semiannual meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries adjourned last night, but the final communique may not have been the last word.","D","11","1981-05-28T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/27792946-d809-5014-b43e-4d36b4d5f421",1106,"nyt://article/27792946-d809-5014-b43e-4d36b4d5f421"

The whole truth is more elusive. Outsiders can only speculate about the motives of the secretive Saudi ruling family. But a good guess is that, for the moment, the Saudis see their own interests converging with those of the West.

"  Reworking the Budget   President Reagan, who took the financial markets to task last week for lacking faith in his tax and budget proposals, is finding Congress increasingly skittish about following through on budget cuts that had seemed quite likely only a few weeks ago.   As predicted, item-by-item scrutiny of proposed cuts has brought forth the programs' supporters. The possibility that the President will not get the full $36 billion reduction in nondefense spending called for under the current budget resolution has made compromise on taxes increasingly important, some analysts say.   Lawrence Chimerine of Chase Econometrics now expects about $47 billion in tax cuts to survive, about $7 billion less than the current Reagan proposal. While a multi-year reduction in personal taxes seems likely, Mr. Chimerine says a two-year, 8 percent reduction in rates stands the best chance of passing Congress. And investment-oriented proposals to expand exemptions for individual retirement accounts and lower the maximum tax rate on unearned income and capital gains taxes are likely winners, he says, as is a lower ''marriage penalty.'' The more moderate cuts are to offset spending that may run $25 billion higher than Administration estimates for the coming fiscal year.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/business/prospects.html","","Reworking the Budget","3","1","1981-05-31T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/a7840c22-96a7-5253-ac62-b85e3723f403",700,"nyt://article/a7840c22-96a7-5253-ac62-b85e3723f403"

By John Kenneth Galbraith   In 1897 - or, more likely, late the previous year - Mrs. Bradley Martin, a rich and renowned New York hostess of the time, learned, no one knows quite how, that the poor of New York were having an especially difficult winter. She resolved to do something about it.  The Waldorf was requisitioned for a party that still stands preeminent in the annals of American hospitality. The hotel space was converted into a rough approximation of the chateau at Versailles; the guests came in the costume, more or less, of the period; the cost was close to $400,000 in the exceptionally substantial currency of the late 19th century. The Martins could reflect, assuming they were so able or disposed, that they had provided considerable employment for the afflicted of the city. That, anyhow, was the stated justification for the event and the expenditure.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/magazine/the-uses-and-excuses-for-affluence.html","","John Kenneth Galbraith is Paul M.

We are in a mechanized system in which thinking has become stereotyped, and in which people have not fully assimilated in their minds and in their hearts the new power of the information media.

"  To the Editor:    William Safire finally noticed (in his ''Gluts to the Gluttons'' column June 3) what perceptive energy analysts have been pointing out for months, if not years: the oil glut of 1977-78 was only temporarily removed by the recent troubles in Iran and Iraq.   Moreover, the sharp oil-price increases stemming from these troubles will continue to reduce worldwide petroleum consumption while increasing non-OPEC supplies and thereby create conditions which OPEC - an arrogant yet poorly managed cartel at best -will regret.   To astute observers, the surprise is not that this outcome is now appearing but only that it has made itself felt so soon.  Despite Safire's implication to the contrary, the Saudis do deserve credit for recognizing and responding intelligently to the new situation. They have been trying to persuade their OPEC associates that the rapid price rises implied worldwide economic turmoil and a potential collapse of the oil market, but their pleas have fallen on deaf ears; their foresight has been rewarded with abuse and recrimination from the other OPEC members.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/14/opinion/l-letters-saudi-arabia-the-oil-glut-and-an-ill-conceived-call-for-us-daring-155706.html","","To the Editor:","4","18","1981-06-14T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/6756bbb6-f295-5642-a4e5-e921afdf4b9d",693,"nyt://article/6756bbb6-f295-5642-a4e5-e921afdf4b9d"

"  uf813 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   In the first solid indication that any of the African oil producers might be willing to lower their prices, Nigeria has agreed to sell 100,000 barrels of oil a day at $37.50 a barrel, beginning tomorrow, to a group of Zurich-based oil traders, a Nigerian oil industry source reported yesterday.   The deal marks a discount of $2.50 a barrel from Nigeria's official contract price of $40 a barrel.  The report came a week after Nigeria, Algeria and Libya - whose oil is the highest priced among all members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries - had said they would not drop their official prices of $40 to $41 a barrel, despite the worldwide oil glut. Holding Tough Discussions   Oil industry officials cautioned, however, that there was no indication yet that Nigeria was ready to offer a similar discount to the major oil companies, which buy most of that country's current production of 850,000 barrels a day. Representatives of the companies were said yesterday to be engaged in tough discussions with the Nigerians and with other African oil producers.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/business/nigeria-cuts-prices-of-oil-to-traders.html","","uf813 By THOMAS L.

In dizzying succession, it opened the world's first gasoline filling station, acquired oceans of oil beneath the deserts of the Middle East and the swamps of Venezuela, and firmly established itself as one of the leading producers, refiners and purveyors of black gold.   Gulf is now the seventh-largest oil company in the world, the seventh-biggest company in America and a member of the planet's most exclusive business sorority - the Seven Sisters of international oil. On a warm summer evening, the orange light emanating from the crown of the company's headquarters tower in downtown Pittsburgh seems to suggest power, confidence and even a trace of deserved smugness.   Appearances, however, can be deceiving. Over the last half decade, Gulf has been hammered by a political payoff scandal, a battery of lawsuits, the loss of most of its prized foreign oil, declines in domestic output, a ludicrously disadvantageous natural gas sales contract and a devastating change in energy policy by the Government in Canada, where Gulf has vast holdings. Perhaps most painful, however, has been the combination of sharply reduced consumer demand and an overabundance of refining capacity, an industrywide affliction that is stinging Gulf particularly.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/05/business/gulf-smallest-of-the-seven-oil-sisters.html","","FEW Companies have a historq as grand and glorious as that of the Gulf Oil Corporation.

The plant is owned by a consortium of New England utility companies and municipal electric cooperatives. Northeast Utilities, which has a 65 percent share of the unit and is the state's largest electricity company, has made it the key to reducing its reliance on fuel oil. By 1987, the first full year the plant is expected to be in service, the utility says its nuclear capacity will replace six million barrels of fuel oil annually, a factor the company says will mean substantial savings for its customers.   But critics of the plant contend that it is not the best way to achieve the savings the utility is aiming for.  ''I think, in general, building nuclear power plants is an uneconomic way to reduce our oil dependence,'' said Roger Koontz, a Hartford-based attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation of New England who has testified against the plant before the State Public Utilities Control Authority.

By the end of controls, the price of this natural gas would climb to the price of oil, the most likely alternative fuel.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/04/business/talking-business-with-david-foster-natural-gas-supply-decontrolling-natural-gas.html","","David H.

On a summer evening in 1980, the godfathers of OPEC (''the most threatening organization in the history of the modern world'') arrive by private jet, limousine and helicopter at the secluded Saudi Arabian mountain resort of Taif to launch a ''revolution in world power'' that is ''once again led by the Arabs of Islam.'' They are about to sign a secret report that ''outlines a major new social contract for the world,'' and ''aims for nothing less than a new alliance between the Arabs and the peoples of the Third World against their traditional exploiters, the industrialized West.'' It is ''a warning, a challenge and finally a demand for a massive transfer of technology from the United States, Europe and Japan to the poor and needy.

"  Gasoline prices in the United States are expected to remain generally stable and possibly dip slightly over the next few months because of the failure yesterday of the oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on a uniform pricing policy.   The result is particularly good news in view of the widespread expectation before and during the ministers' meeting in Geneva that OPEC would agree to a range of prices between $34 and $37 a barrel, rather than the current $32 to $40.   Had the new range been adopted, with its $34 minimum price, it would have increased gasoline prices in the United States, many of which are tied to the $32 price that Saudi Arabia charges for its basic crude. OPEC's indecisiveness thus, in effect, saved American drivers 3 cents or more a gallon, oil analysts calculate. 'Good News for the Consumer'   ''Obviously this is good news for the consumer,'' said John H.  Lichtblau, executive director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/22/business/ray-of-hope-on-oil-prices-news-analysis.html","","Gasoline prices in the United States are expected to remain generally stable and possibly dip slightly over the next few months because of the failure yesterday of the oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on a uniform pricing policy.","1","1","1981-08-22T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/7963cd15-dd6b-5b06-9b44-ae6f1ba42d6b",1446,"nyt://article/7963cd15-dd6b-5b06-9b44-ae6f1ba42d6b"

"  A three-day meeting of OPEC oil ministers ended today in failure to reach agreement on a new, lower range of prices.But Saudi Arabia, which accounts for one-fifth of the West's oil production, said it would maintain its price of $32 a barrel through 1982.   The OPEC meeting, which many participants considered the most divisive and difficult in the group's 21-year history, appears to have produced a decisive victory for the Saudi policy of applying pressure to reduce world oil prices.   One result of the meeting is that prices of petroleum products in the United States probably will remain stable or perhaps dip slightly.

But at the same time, oil wealth has partly masked the continued decline of British industries. In addition, exporters have been battered by the strong pound resulting from oil sales. And to some minds, the Government's growing tax revenue from the sale of oil has worked to bolster Government spending, rather than investment.

"  Armco Inc., projecting that the oil and gas drilling boom would continue at least to end of the century, announced yesterday that it would spend $671 million to build new mills and upgrade an old one to increase the production of seamless tubular goods for the industry, which are now in short supply.   Harry Holiday, chief executive of Armco, said in a telephone interview that studies by the company had concluded that even after new pipe mills announced by Armco and other steel producers were ready, the domestic capacity to produce pipe would total about 3.1 million tons by 1986.

"  A PROMINENT energy expert, an oil company public relations man and a newspaper energy correspondent were recently dining in the sort of expense-account palace that the self-styled energy ''community'' has come, in recent years, to consider its due. The conversation took a disturbing turn.   ''Do you think the energy crisis may actually be over?'' the journalist said, reaching for his wine glass.  His companions coughed loudly. ''I hope not,'' the energy guru said. ''We'd all be out of a job.'' Indeed, for an increasing number of foundations, consultants, experts and public interest groups, the energy crisis amounts to a livelihood. For not a few oil companies, it adds up to a tad more.

Updike, though, published ''Rabbit Run'' in 1960, ''Rabbit Redux'' in 1971 -and now ''Rabbit Is Rich.''

A Santa Fe spokesman said that Kuwait's interest in the company reflected ''an opportunity to diversify into another line of business, that is, petroleum services.''

"  An Appetite for Debt   Wall Street may see its fears about the cost of Reagan-omics borne out this week when the fiscal year's first refunding offering is made. And, while the credit markets are expecting government borrowings to be large, some analysts fear the impact on short-term rates may be worse than anticipated. Rising interest costs, lower corporate profits and financing the first tax cut means the Government will have to raise $35 billion in new cash this quarter, says David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston. And unless the economy falls into a fairly steep recession, business borrowing is likely to stay brisk, keeping short-term rates high. With new tax cuts set for later this year, Mr. Jones doubts Washington's appetite for new money will diminish, and could reach $100 billion this fiscal year, a record.

I believe there are a great many who feel that the trend is a threat, not only to the economic security of the United States but to its very independence.   he Reagan Administration has just gone on record (news story Oct.  23) as being ''favorably inclined'' to grant leasing privileges on United States-owned mineral (including oil) lands to the Kuwait National Petroleum Company, which is owned by the Government of Kuwait. Given the virtually unlimited funds of the OPEC countries, this policy could ultimately lead to United States dependence on those countries even for oil produced from resources in the United States.

Oil industry analysts had predicted after the Oct. 30 conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that the weighted average price of its crude would increase by $1 to $2 a barrel, if all 13 member countries took full advantage of OPEC's newly forged price framework.   However, oil company sources contend that the continued surplus on the world market - despite Saudi Arabia's cutback of 700,000 barrels a day on Nov. 1 - has made it impossible for many oil-producing countries to demand the new maximum rates established by OPEC.

"  Throughout much of the 1970's the Consolidated Edison Company of New York was viewed as one of the nation's most troubled electric utilities. It committed the blasphemy of omitting a dividend payment in 1974. Its credit was deemed so risky that it had no credit rating at all. And stock market analysts did not even want to discuss the company, let alone recommend that their clients buy some of its depressed shares.   ''We were the pariah of the industry,'' Arthur Hauspurg, Consolidated Edison's president, said in an interview. ''When we skipped a dividend, everybody in the industry hated us -analysts, all the other utilities, everybody. But when I see many of those same people today, they say our skipping a dividend was the best thing that ever happened to the industry. It shocked the rate commissions into loosening up and helped lay the basis for where we are today.''   Where Con Edison is today - at least as Wall Street sees it - is at the end of a transformation.  It is a recovery that many Wall Street analysts contend has become a model for electric utilities around the nation. The company's earnings were up 52 percent in the third quarter to a record $202.9 million, or $3.05 a share, and Con Ed's stock price has been regularly pushing through its yearly high.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/19/business/con-ed-wins-wall-st-praise.html","","Throughout much of the 1970's the Consolidated Edison Company of New York was viewed as one of the nation's most troubled electric utilities.

"  Sagging Sales   'Tis the season to be jolly, but consumers seem anything but. Even though disposable incomes are rising -a rare event during periods of economic decline - concern about unemployment lines, not visions of sugarplums, are dancing through shoppers' heads. Fearful of the consequences, retailers are sacrificing profit margins to secure sales, and are discounting heavily. As a result, Christmas sales should rise 10 percent to 12 percent from a year earlier, say Elizabeth Allison and Evan Barrington, economists at Data Resources.  Yet sharp declines in durable goods purchases should cause fourthquarter retail sales to fall to an inflation-adjusted $135 billion. Moreover, the deepening recession and increased savings incentives should lead to further real declines through the first half of 1982. While this will stymie economic recovery in the short run, the longterm benefits may outweigh the costs. The longer consumer demand remains weak, the more inflation is likely to ease. Tough Trade Talks   Like oil and water, recessions and free trade don't mix. Amid rising cries from Congress and industry to consider new trade curbs, two United States delegations will be traveling abroad this week trying to smooth out long-standing disputes with officials from the Common Market and Japan.","https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/06/business/prospects.html","","Sagging Sales","3","1","1981-12-06T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/f4a94a1e-a8fe-5493-8663-46f665df2ec6",706,"nyt://article/f4a94a1e-a8fe-5493-8663-46f665df2ec6"

"OPEC TRIMS PRICES; LIBYAN ASKS IN VAIN FOR ANTI-U.S. MOVES   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates, Dec. 11 (By The Associated Press) - Faced with a worldwide oversupply of oil that seems likely to continue, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed today to shave some of its prices, although probably not by enough to lower the price of gasoline and heating oil in the United States.   The latest OPEC decision contrasted sharply with the results of many of the group's traditional December meetings over the past eight years, when it decided on oil price increases that drove up the world's energy costs. No Action on Libyan Demand   Sources close to the oil ministers, who as always met behind closed doors, said the group had also rejected a Libyan request to blacklist American oil companies whose personnel leave Libya in response to a request by President Reagan.  Mr. Reagan urged the companies yesterday to withdraw their personnel promptly and he plans to invalidate American passports for travel to Libya.   The ministers were said to have listened ""politely,"" but took no action on Libya's demand that OPEC take unified steps against United States oil companies.  Libya's oil minister, Abdussalam Mohammed Zagaar, was quoted as denouncing the United States for taking an ""illegal and unfair"" action.

"  THE MONEY LENDERS Bankers and a World in Turmoil.  By Anthony Sampson.  336 pp. New York: The Viking Press. $16.95.   THE ostensible subject of Anthony Sampson's excellent exercise in the higher journalism is the assortment of bankers - particularly money market titans like Chase, Citibank, West Germany's Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank, and their few peers - whose mission has been gracefully to accept tens of billions of dollars in OPEC deposits and promptly shuffle similar sums as loans to such heavy borrowers in the developing world as Zaire, South Korea, Indonesia, Turkey, Peru and Brazil. Mr. Sampson expresses appropriate admiration for the technical virtuosity deployed by the banking fraternity and its colleagues at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in keeping afloat a global financial and trading system severely challenged by OPEC's 1973 rearrangement of the planet's pecking order.   Nobody can say how long this process of financial recycling will endure. Out of pique, obscure political calculation or sheer economic miscalculation, the Middle Eastern members of OPEC could decide to leave their oil in the ground and precipitate deep depression in the Western world. A major third world debtor might default, despite adroit maneuvers by lenders to reschedule repayments of interest and principal. Or a major lender just might refuse to throw good money after bad and thus precipitate a chain reaction of defaults in the third world.","https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/03/books/the-universe-of-money.html","","THE MONEY LENDERS Bankers and a World in Turmoil.

"  IN a report that is bound to be controversial, a leading petroleum comme ntator a rgues that the price of OPEC oil may crack as early as the middle of this year, and that the decline will help the economiesof the rest o f the world.   It's generally accepted that the current oversupply of oil on world markets has tempered price demands by the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and was a factor in Libya's recent decision to trim its price by 50 cents a barrel.

"  Saudi Arabia, confronted by sharply declining oil prices and a substantial excess in world supplies, may be ready to make deep cuts in its oil production.   With prices on the spot market down by more than 5 percent in the past 10 days, the companies pumping Saudi oil are believed to be curtailing their purchases. These companies -Exxon, Mobil, Texaco and Standard Oil of California - customarily dispose of oil they do not need on the spot market, and they have recently been losing about a dollar on every barrel they sell.   Already, Saudi Arabia's daily production has declined by nearly 2.5 million barrels a day from last year's peak of 10.3 million.

The problems afflicting visitors to Venezuela's capital in the five years following the 1973-74 oil boom - an outdated airport, overcrowded hotels, poor public services and overbooked airlines - have been reduced substantially.   The great press of foreign visitors that Venezuela experienced during those years has eased off, and incoming travelers (mostly business people and tourists on short excursions) can be accommodated quite well.

An impossible dream? No, not pie in the sky. The answer was put forward in this space a year ago and makes even more sense in today's urgent straits: The President should turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which gives him the authority to adjust imports in the interest of national security, and impose a $10 per barrel fee on imported oil.

"  OPEC's Last Waltz?   Times have never been worse for OPEC. Oil prices keep slipping, economists keep pushing back estimates of the strength and timing of recovery in major consuming nations, and the cartel's own revenues are falling sharply. So the OPEC gathering in Vienna this week is likely to be a critical and cantankerous one.   Much of action may take place before Friday, when the session formally begins, says Philip Verleger, an oil analyst with Booz Allen Hamilton. In order to defuse bickering about future production levels, Saudi Arabia, which has cut ouput by roughly 3 million barrels a day in the last 12 months, to 7.5 million, may announce more cuts as well as a price drop of around $2 a barrel. However, those steps may not be enough, Mr. Verleger says.","https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/14/business/prospects.html","","OPEC's Last Waltz?","3","1","1982-03-14T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/1e748163-ce3e-54de-8e04-25ecfa22d824",746,"nyt://article/1e748163-ce3e-54de-8e04-25ecfa22d824"

It's been a long sequence of recessions and weak, aborted expansions.   Is this, then, a depression we are in? Looking backward, the term seems too strong. The economy has been stagnating, not collapsing. If the roof were to fall in later this year, or next, it could become a depression, but the odds are still against it.

"  Oil ministers of the 13 OPEC nations gathered here today for a crucial policy meeting amid uncertainty that the group could find a way to prevent the worldwide abundance of oil from forcing a general reduction in prices.   ''I don't believe we can make a formal decision about production levels,'' said Humberto Calderon Berti, the Venezuelan minister of energy, referring to proposals that OPEC production be cut back to remove enough oil from the market to firm up prices.   Earlier this week, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the Saudi Arabian oil minister, reportedly told a confidant, ''This will be the most difficult meeting I've attended.''

"  WASHINGTON THE Chrysler Corporation, with sales of big cars this year running 20 percent ahead of 1981 levels, is worried enough to urge a 25-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline.

This is the dark side of the great oil glut.

"  After two years of the most furious deal-making and well-drilling activity in history, the American oil rush of the 1980's appears to be tailing off.   The combination of plummeting oil prices and high interest rates is causing independent oil operators to husband their money and abandon wildcat operations in favor of surer results in proven oilfields.   As a result, industry experts say, domestic oil production could begin to fall again. As the drilling boom of 1980 and 1981 gathered momentum and new reserves were opened, a long-term drop in domestic oil production came to a halt.   But, according to John E.

"  AS Congress confronts President Reagan's prescription for economic revitalization, the nation is staggering through one of the worst slumps since World War II. Debate about the nature of Mr. Reagan's remedy is being conducted simultaneously with debate over the structure of the economy itself.   Last week, The Week in Review brought together three experts on the economy and its workings - David M. Gordon, chairman of the economics department of the New School for Social Research and director of the Center for Democratic Alternatives, a New York-based research and educational institute; Felix G. Rohatyn, senior partner in the investment banking firm of Lazard Freres & Co. and chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, New York City's finance agency; and Walter B. Wriston, chairman of Citicorp and Citibank and a member of the President's Economic Policy Advisory Board. Excerpts of their discussion with Leonard Silk, The New York Times's economics columnist, follow.   Question. Let's start with the present state of the economy.  Clearly, we are in a recession. Are we in a more serious situation, in what once upon a time would have been called a depression, that has lasted several years and included some dips and recoveries? Or if depression isn't really the right word, is there reason to call it a repression - that is, the result of deliberate Government policy for suppressing inflation?","https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/04/weekinreview/the-ailing-economy-diagnoses-and-prescriptions.html","","AS Congress confronts President Reagan's prescription for economic revitalization, the nation is staggering through one of the worst slumps since World War II.

"  WASHINGTON THE moon has its dark side, and so does the slide in world oil prices. Although it has already led to lower inflation in the United States and other oil-importing countries and might help boost them out of recession, the drop in oil prices could also cause further tightening in international lending, especially to the more impoverished countries of the third world.   Even some third world oil exporters have been caught in the squeeze. Nigeria, a heavy borrower which has been running a monthly trade deficit of $600 million, last week froze virtually all imports because of the decline in its oil revenues. The most populous African country with nearly 100 million inhabitants, it is under pressure to cut prices more deeply than permitted by OPEC agreements to try to increase sales and revenues. Acting in support of Nigeria - and the oil cartel's $34-a-barrel benchmark price - Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have threatened to cancel contracts with international oil companies that reduce purchases of Nigeria's $36.50-a-barrel oil in favor of equally high-grade $31 oil from the North Sea and other non-OPEC sources. Saudi Arabia also is reportedly extending emergency credits to Nigeria to keep it from breaking ranks with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on prices.","https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/04/weekinreview/oil-price-drop-puts-squeeze-on-lending-to-poor-nations.html","","WASHINGTON THE moon has its dark side, and so does the slide in world oil prices.

This idea, which may seem perverse to consumers finally enjoying some relief from rising energy prices, calls for a fee of $5 to $10 for each barrel of crude oil or oil products imported by the United States.   An import fee is now supported by a growing number of Congressmen and by several of President Reagan's senior economic advisers, mainly because the extra revenues could make big inroads into huge projected Federal budget deficits and at the same time reduce further American dependence on foreign oil. The Background   The United States has had considerable experience with efforts to curb imports of foreign oil. In 1959 President Eisenhower issued a proclamation creating the Mandatory Oil Import Program, which was intended to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil by imposing restrictions on volume.","https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/08/business/issue-and-debate-oil-import-fee-talk-growing.html","","The phenomenon of the world oil glut and tumbling prices has been accompanied in recent months by increasing talk about imposing a special tax on imported oil.

"  The Government has signed an agreement to buy bargain-priced Iranian oil for its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, thereby opening the United States market to Iran's oil for the first time since shortly after the American hostages were seized in November 1979.   The Department of Energy said today that a contract was issued last Thursday under which Gatoil International Inc., a Geneva-based trading company, is to supply 1.8 million barrels of oil worth $53.12 million for delivery to the reserve in June.   ''It's a good price, good oil and we bought it,'' said Philip D.  Keif, a department spokesman.

For one thing, lending to countries, which has been one of the banks' favorite kinds of international business, has become far more uncertain after the problems in Poland, Rumania and now Argentina.   Perhaps more important, the margins between the interest rates charged on international loans and the rates that must be paid on deposits have remained stubbornly narrow and, despite widespread predictions to the contrary, have shown only the faintest signs of improving.

''Exxon believes the final cost would be more than twice as much as we thought it would be when we entered the project.''

The latter purpose is being obscured by the former and by considering only short-range consumer interests.   Crude oil prices may or may not continue downward. Optimists feel Iran and Iraq will increase oil exports and OPEC will not be able to maintain its unity.

"  OPEC Buys Some Time   Three months ago, as its oil ministers gathered in Vienna, things looked bleak for OPEC. Production remained high, and the outlook for demand in major consuming nations was not good. Prices, which had been softening for much of 1981, seemed ready to dip even more. But conditions have now changed.   As the cartel gathers in Ecuador this week, experts say that recent production cuts - even steeper than those agreed to in March - are bringing supply and demand back into balance. If OPEC can continue such discipline, and maintain output at around 16 million barrels a day, the $34 contract price should hold through the summer, said Philip Verleger, an analyst at Booz Allen & Hamilton.","https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/16/business/prospects.html","","OPEC Buys Some Time","3","1","1982-05-16T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/b86d1207-674c-5d26-b89c-32be36d6512b",733,"nyt://article/b86d1207-674c-5d26-b89c-32be36d6512b"

In January 1979, the OPEC benchmark price for crude oil was $13.34 a barrel.  Then the Shah fled Iran and Iranian oil production plummeted. The surplus became a shortage and the price of oil tripled in very short order. Coal was good to have and we were unable to supply the world demand fast enough.","https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/30/business/l-coal-may-not-be-king-but-it-s-doing-well-173356.html","","To the Business Editor: Given that the coal market is suffering from overproduction and lack of demand, its overall prospects are much brighter than the bearish evaluation given by Robert D.

The Brown thesis is that prices the Aramco companies paid Saudi Arabia for oil during the recent market surplus period were suspect.  Since the price charged by the Saudi Government exceeded the price at which some Saudi crude could be acquired in the spot market, the entire series of purchases somehow is suspicious. Thus, he urges that special, harsh tax treatment be considered against the Aramco companies.","https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/06/business/wishful-thinkinng-on-the-spot-market.html","WILLIAM M.

"  After the Soviet Pipeline   The initial impact of the Administration's decision to block construction of the Soviet pipeline and to deny high-technology licenses to foreign suppliers who trade with Moscow seems largely confined to the State Department. Experts say it will not be long, however, before the shock waves spread far beyond Foggy Bottom.

"  Early this year, the Islamic revolutionary regime was sunk so deep in a fiscal crisis that foreign analysts did not see how it could continue paying for vital food imports and meeting the huge Government payroll on which most Iranians depend for their livelihood.   By this summer, however, Iran had maneuvered out of its difficult position by dramatically increasing oil exports, and thus revenue.  Crude exports rose to two million barrels a day, almost half the level before the revolution, compared with a dismal 400,000 barrels in early 1982.   ''The Iranians are awash in money now,'' an economist in a Western embassy said.  But Iran's solution carries a potentially heavy price. Its oil is exported via the spot, or noncontract, market, rather than under long-term agreements. That means the Iranians are receiving less than the official price, $34 a barrel, set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

Now the oil world is watching anxiously to see whether a major break in prices materializes or the cartel again manages to pull itself back from the brink.   OPEC's decision in March to set national quotas and an overall production ceiling of 17.5 million barrels a day stiffened prices for a while. But several producers - most flagrantly, Iran and Nigeria - began exceeding their quotas. Production lately has risen to about 18.2 million barrels a day and Saudi Arabian light oil - officially $34 a barrel - has drifted down on the spot market. Last week, despite the new fighting between Iran and Iraq, Saudi light was being quoted at $31.50 a barrel.","https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/18/weekinreview/it-s-a-buyer-s-market-now-but-don-t-sell-opec-short.html","","For the moment, the only direction oil prices seem likely to go is down.

"THE CHOSEN INSTRUMENT Pan Am. Juan Trippe.  The Rise and Fall of an American Entrepreneur.  By Marylin Bender and Selig Altschul.  Illustrated. 605 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $19.95.

''THE CHOSEN INSTRUMENT,'' an exceptionally well-done and interesting example of the generally dull genre of business history, is the interwoven story of Juan Trippe and Pan American World Airways, of which he was the progenitor. The book pursues its human and corporate subjects from the years immediately after World War I practically until today, when, as in the 1920's, Pan Am is an enterprise with serious financial problems, many of them the consequences of decisions taken along Juan Trippe's path to glory.  Since 1979, Pan Am has lost nearly $600 million and sold off most of its nonoperating assets to raise cash. Now it hovers on the edge of insolvency. The wheel has turned full circle. 

In the wake of World War I, Juan Trippe, then a young stockbroker fresh from Yale, coaxed his rich college friends into financing a decidedly speculative venture. It was no more than fitting that when the Pan Am building, one of Walter Gropius's less inspired designs, was erected in Manhattan in 1963, its main entrance on Vanderbilt Avenue was right across the street from the Yale Club.","https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/25/books/a-man-and-his-airline.html","THE CHOSEN INSTRUMENT Pan Am.

It is not a date Administration officials are likely to celebrate. They are too busy working on another tax package - one that would erase many of last year's cuts.   To reduce Federal deficits and help calm the credit markets, the Administration is supporting an effort in Congress to take back, over a three-year period, some $99 billion of the $749 billion cut last summer.

"  Undaunted by the Reagan Administration's effort to limit the American presence here, United States oil companies have increased production in recent months to levels in excess of the quota of 750,000 barrels a day set for Libya by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   The production increases, Western oil sources said, were the result of pricing concessions that enable companies to purchase oil at $32 a barrel, a $3.50 discount from the level set by OPEC last spring for the best grade of oil from Libya.   The sources also said that Libya was flouting other OPEC guidelines designed to prevent barter trade and unauthorized price reductions.  Breaking ranks with other North African producers, Libya is offering a discount of $2 a barrel on short-term contracts and is heavily engaged in barter deals to pay off foreign debts amounting to $2 billion due now.","https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/13/business/oil-output-in-libya-increased.html","","Undaunted by the Reagan Administration's effort to limit the American presence here, United States oil companies have increased production in recent months to levels in excess of the quota of 750,000 barrels a day set for Libya by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.","D","1","1982-09-13T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/cfd7668d-9304-5e35-9223-90d3bc97673e",929,"nyt://article/cfd7668d-9304-5e35-9223-90d3bc97673e"

"  In raising tax revenues, Congress went looking for businesses that paid little or no taxes. The oil industry was a prime target. While the industry pays some taxes on its American income, it pays relatively little on income earned abroad.

"The grave disorder in the world's banking system is now plain for all to see.

At the heart of the problem are loans amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars to weak countries.  The ability of these borrowers to service or repay the principal on their ballooning debt is now openly questioned. De facto defaults have occurred and more are imminent. Formal default has been avoided but only by postponing obligations; these postponements are becoming so common that the distinction between formal and actual default has become virtually academic. However, each failure to pay contributes to a cash-flow problem for the banks. This process is visible to the banks' depositors, who are now withdrawing funds on an increasing scale.

The growth in lending to weak countries developed at a time when multinational corporate borrowers, too, were greatly extending their reliance on the international banking system. The banks' overoptimism in relation to borrowing nations seems to have spilled over to their lending to these corporate borrowers. The result is that many corporate borrowings are as shaky as those of the borrowing nations.","https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/24/opinion/international-bankings-house-of-cards.html","The grave disorder in the world's banking system is now plain for all to see.

"  The 12th Quarter   As the nation enters the year's final quarter, Administration officials have seized on recent data revisions and estimates of economic growth for the second and third quarters to proclaim the onset of recovery. But given the margins for error in measuring such things, the gains are more likely to be statistical than real. As most analysts see it, the economy remains mired in a recession that began three years ago and hasn't ended.   Output has stayed remarkably flat over the period despite nine quarters of growth.

It is an exhilarating sensation, but if the pilot loses the air current, his frail device may plunge. Just so, analysts believe that a modest bulge in oil supplies could eliminate some - or even all - of the recent price gains.   So those buying oil stocks may be well rewarded, but vigilance and quick reactions may be necessary if they are to avoid catastrophe.  For the short-term trader, share appreciation may be especially hard to come by in domestic companies that produce natural gas and crude oil.

"  An oil shortage and price run-up is likely to undermine any Western economic recovery after 1985 unless countries do more to reduce dependence on imported oil, the International Energy Agency warned today.   The agency, which coordinates Western energy policies, predicted that oil prices would decrease ''significantly'' this year and next, after adjustment for inflation. It based that prediction on the current oversupply of oil.   Supply and demand should balance out in 1985, the agency said, but it expects a growing shortage to emerge during the second half of this decade, assuming that Western economies start growing again at an annual rate of between 2.7 and 3.2 percent.

Nationally, the winter of 1982 was 3 percent colder than the winter of 1981 (5 percent in this area), but 6 percent less heating oil was used.

For now, and in the immediate future, the odds still favor maintenance of prices at about current levels. However, the possibility of a deep price break, uncontrollable by OPEC, sometime in 1983 cannot be ignored. Producing a barrel of oil costs a fraction of the current average OPEC price of $33 a barrel, so the price drop in a free fall could be substantial. Thus the stakes in a price collapse are very large - although the likelihood of such a plunge is small.","https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/12/business/opecs-humbling-could-be-a-problem.html","NEXT Sunday OPEC oil ministers will gather in Vienna to try to d etermine a new price for oil.

"  Last of six articles that have appeared periodically on current world economic problems   After three decades of the greatest growth in history, the world economy has been caught for the last three years in what a committee of international economists assembled by the United   Nations calls ''a vicious spiral of contraction.'' The key economic issue facing all nations today is how to break that spiral and get back on a path of steady growth. But there are sharp disagreements among governments on how to proceed.   High unemployment in the industrial world, the most severe since the Depression of the 1930's, is increasing pressure on governments to pursue ''beggar my neighbor'' policies, excluding foreign goods or devaluing currencies to save jobs at home, whatever the consequences for other nations. Suffering and Instability   Disputes between industrialized countries and developing countries have grown worse as the developing nations see the prices of their commodities fall and the incomes of many of their people depressed to - or below -the subsistence level.","https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/13/business/world-economic-issue-economic-analysis.html","","Last of six articles that have appeared periodically on current world economic problems","A","1","1982-12-13T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/5b65eae3-bc42-51fa-aebd-a549ef65e2fc",3007,"nyt://article/5b65eae3-bc42-51fa-aebd-a549ef65e2fc"

"  To the Editor:    In your reports on the recent meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna (news stories Dec. 20 and 21), you said that ''this year, for the first time, non-OPEC oilproducing countries ... will produce more crude oil than the group's members'' and that ''output by such (non-member) countries ... exceeded OPEC's for the first time this year.''   OPEC's share of the world's crude-oil production has indeed declined sharply - from 53 percent in 1973 to 48 percent in 1978 and to as little as 33 percent for the first 10 months of this year; yet, except for the years from 1973 to 1977, non-OPEC output has always exceeded that of the organization's 13 members.   The control that OPEC countries such as Saudi Arabia, Libya, Iran and Venezuela have repeatedly and dramatically wielded over world oil prices has not been based on the quantity or global proportion of OPEC's output. (Historically, the United States was the world's leading producer, until overtaken by the Soviet Union in 1974.) Rather, it is based on the position of OPEC members as marginal producers - who in a tight market can drive up prices by threatening to withhold supplies.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/03/opinion/l-opec-is-alive-if-not-as-well-as-in-1980-138668.html","","To the Editor:","A","18","1983-01-03T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/2f4f988b-b090-5c96-a81b-e2ac0298bcfb",319,"nyt://article/2f4f988b-b090-5c96-a81b-e2ac0298bcfb"

"The breakdown of the OPEC meeting in Geneva yesterday has set the stage for a slight decline in oil prices and a further cutback in production by Saudi Arabia and its allies on the Arabian Peninsula, energy economists said yesterday.

But a sharp drop in the price of oil from the current world average of about $33 for a 42-gallon barrel appeared unlikely - at least for the present, the economists said. The current price among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is based on $34 for Saudi Light crude.

Total oil production by Saudi Arabia and its neighbors has declined to about 8.5 million barrels a day, from an average of 13.7 million in 1980, as they have tried to maintain their price structure despite the abundance of oil in world markets.

From conversations with delegates and from comments by Sheik Yamani at a briefing, his approach at the meeting here of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may be summarized in this way:   The 13 nations must recognize that oil prices have to come down, at least a bit, in an orderly way. If they do not, Saudi Arabia and its allies on the Arabian Peninsula will lower prices anyway and increase their production to win back the customers that they have lost to price discounters within OPEC.   But if maverick discounting is halted, realistic production programs can be drawn up for all members, stability will return to the market and oil revenues will flow equitably.

"  PARIS THE Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may be a victim of its own success, a condition unlikely to evoke sympathy from some in the West. But does the industrialized world really have an interest in watching the cartel die? This is the dilemma posed for oil consumers and other producers as OPEC flounders in a world awash with energy, unable to control the plummeting price of oil.   For almost a decade, OPEC has been draining the wealth and the independence of the Western industrial powers by forcing them to pay more for its oil. Since the first big oil price hike in 1974, the West has paid more than a trillion dollars into OPEC's coffers, probably the largest forced transfer of wealth since the Spanish conquistadores plundered the gold of ancient Peru. Wealth Is a Burden   During this decade, OPEC became more than an oil producers' cartel. For much of the third world, its success was proof that the developing countries could reverse the global balance of power and establish a new economic order in their favor.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/30/weekinreview/nothing-comes-cheap-not-even-low-oil-prices.html","","PARIS THE Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may be a victim of its own success, a condition unlikely to evoke sympathy from some in the West.

AS candidate and President, Ronald Reagan blamed the stagnation of the American economy on high taxes and excessive regulation of the business sector. A cooperative Congress in 1981 gave Mr. Reagan most of what he asked for, and the economy ungratefully slid into the deepest recession in more than 40 years. Conservatives impute blame to unions, but less than a quarter of the labor force holds a union card, and unions have voluntarily accepted reduction of painfully negotiated wages and benefits.

"  A sharp decline in world oil prices could hurt the nation's banks more because of their loan exposure to the energy industry than because of their loans to oil-producing countries.   This conclusion, which emerges from interviews with bankers and economists in the United States and overseas, sees the potential for many commercial energy producers and related companies to be squeezed by a steep drop in energy prices. This, in turn, could cause large losses at many banks that are active energy lenders, and the failure of some.   At the same time, banking experts point out, direct loans to the energy producing countries are relatively safer because the major industrial nations would likely mount rescue operations to prevent any from collapsing.   A sharp decline in the price of oil is considered possible in coming months because of the world's reduced energy requirements and the resulting disagreements among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries about how to defend prices.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/14/business/banks-and-oil-pricing-outook.html","","A sharp decline in world oil prices could hurt the nation's banks more because of their loan exposure to the energy industry than because of their loans to oil-producing countries.","D","1","1983-02-14T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/7d67e85f-cc1a-588a-8550-a535ce5ca345",1854,"nyt://article/7d67e85f-cc1a-588a-8550-a535ce5ca345"

Not even OPEC-controlled oil has gone up to this extent. Winter gas bills are now averaging more than $200 per month, with bills in excess of $300 very common.

"  To the Editor:    In its advertisement on your Feb. 10 Op-Ed page, the Mobil Corporation lashes out at the recently proposed oil-import fee on the grounds that it would fan inflation, increase the U.S. trade deficit, encourage foreign oil producers to seek higher prices and undermine free trade. None of these objections can be taken seriously.

"The plunge in oil prices is grabbing headlines these days. But in fact a decline has been under way for some time. Tracing the economic and political developments that have shaped the oil market over the past few years shows how the stage was set for the price break.

What follows is an attempt to answer key questions about what is happening to oil prices, and why.  Q. Why are oil prices declining? A. The simplest, and perhaps the best, reasons can be found in the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its major customers. During 1979 and 1980, oil output in Iran and Iraq, two of the world's largest oil producers, was sharply curtailed. When the Iran-Iraq war broke out in 1980, production in the two nations almost ceased for a brief period. Crude oil was temporarily in short supply and panicky oil buyers seemed willing to pay almost any price for it. The 13 members of OPEC took advantage of the situation and pushed the price for Saudi Light crude oil, OPEC's benchmark, to $34 for each 42-gallon barrel. With the benefit of hindsight, this price was clearly too high.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/26/business/the-factors-pushing-petroleum-costs-down.html","The plunge in oil prices is grabbing headlines these days.

"  To the Editor:   It now seems possible that Saudi Arabia agreed with the Aramco companies, on Jan. 2/3, to lower their price, through some expedients which we will duly learn. To call the rebate an exploration discount would not be credible. That discount was set in 1976 at six cents, a fair enough estimate of what an additional barrel of oil in the ground is worth to the Saudis, who have more oil than they will produce in this century, or perhaps ever.   Prices will fluctuate. On the down side, the competitive floor must be well below $10. But such a price seems very unlikely.

If they had not l ent large sums to less developed countries, the oil shocks of 1 974-75 and 1979-80 would have done far more damage to the whole w orld economy.   Now, in the 1980's, the banks are part of the problem, because they have lent so much to less-developed countries. If economic recovery is slow or weak in the industrial countries, the less developed countries will be unable to service their debts - to pay interest and refinance principal. Worse yet, they will continue to face large balance-of-payments deficits and will be unable to cover them by new borrowings. Moreover, their debt problems may even weaken global recovery.   At the end of 1982, the external debts of these countries (excluding debts of East European countries and of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) exceeded $550 billion. Their debts to banks exceeded $350 billion, including about $130 billion owed to American banks. The total debt is sharply concentrated. Mexico, Brazil and Argentina top a short list of large debtors that also includes such OPEC countries as Venezuela, Indonesia and Nigeria. In the 1970's, you could have counted on the fingers of one hand the countries that had fallen behind in their debt-service payments.

The ministers have tried for the past 10 days to lay the groundwork for an informal meeting of all 13 OPEC members, which they now hope to convene Monday.   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have seen their official prices undermined during the past six months by a worldwide oversupply of oil. This led Nigeria to break with OPEC two weeks ago and lower its official prices in an effort to win back some of its lost markets. Nigeria took this step after price reductions by two non-OPEC members, Brit-ain and Norway. If the optimism expressed today proves well-founded, the ministers and their delegations may go to OPEC headquarters in Vienna for formal adoption of the agreement later this week.

"  The nation's crude oil imports were lower in February than in any month since May 1968, with many of the nation's largest oil companies buying less than half the foreign oil that they had projected would be needed to meet their average demand over the course of the year.   The dramatic drop in imports, reflected in figures released yesterday by the Department of Energy, was largely attributed to the expectation of lower foreign oil prices. ''People are very reluctant to stock up with crude until they know where the price will bottom out,'' said Carl Meyerdirk, a spokesman for the Standard Oil Company (Indiana).   At the same time, oil company executives said the sharply reduced imports would intensify a trend toward liquidation of crude oil and refined petroleum product inventories.

The benefits to the economy from lower oil prices are real: lower inflation, greater real income, more growth and less unemployment.  This is the ''opulence.'' But what of ''defense''? Is it not essential that we look to the security dimension of so strategic a commodity as oil? After a decade in which oil prices rose a devastating 1200 per cent, a combination of factors - including conservation and the proliferation of energy supplies from non-OPEC producers - has led to a dramatic improvement. Our dependence on imported oil has been halved and our dependence on OPEC, especially Persian Gulf, sources have been cut dramatically.

''It's a sticky agreement,'' said John Savoy, an oil economist with the Sun Company, that will work only if there is a sharp increase in demand for oil from the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. ''If demand doesn't pick up by summer,'' he added, OPEC ''could be headed for another emergency meeting and another crisis.''   The analysts said OPEC's agreement would have little or no impact on consumer prices.

"  ''I have a strong feeling that this will work out and that OPEC will be in the driver's seat.'' - Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani   ''It's a sticky agreement. If demand doesn't pick up by summer OPEC could be headed for ... another crisis.'' - John Savoy, Sun Company Most analysts take Sheik Yamani's words as wishful thinking rather than sage prophecy. OPEC's agreement to limit production - the only way it can hold the oil price floor at $29 a barrel - will be extremely hard to enforce. But before euphoria takes over, it's worth remembering some immutable facts of life in the petroleum era: any interruption of oil shipments from the Persian Gulf, or even a modest increase in world demand, could touch off another price explosion.  An aggressive policy to reduce imports is the surest way to keep the OPEC wolf on leash.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/18/opinion/raise-the-odds-against-opec.html","","''I have a strong feeling that this will work out and that OPEC will be in the driver's seat.'' - Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani","A","28","1983-03-18T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/3ece1b4d-ab0f-5957-aedb-20309fd787cd",497,"nyt://article/3ece1b4d-ab0f-5957-aedb-20309fd787cd"

"  The plunge in world petroleum prices, which promises to speed economic recovery in most other parts of the country, is sending tremors of trepidation through Texas and the rest of the American oil region.   The region, whose economy boomed on the five-fold increase in world oil prices over the last decade, now faces the unhappy prospect of watching the depressed industrial states of the North and East lift out of recession while it stagnates as a result of an oil glut.   After the most precipitous drop in drilling of oil and gas wells in Texas history, many here are growing concerned that the region may have become too dependent on its geological endowment on the false assumption that oil and gas prices could not fall.   The question now is whether its economic base is broad enough to preserve the region's new prosperity if there is a prolonged sag in world energy prices. Disagreement Over Future   ''It is quite ironic that not long ago all the rest of the country was wishing they were the Sun Belt and Texas, and now they're glad they're not,'' said Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a leading energy consultant.

"Housing starts, showing unexpected strength, rose 2.9 percent last month to an annual rate of 1.76 million units. It was the fastest pace for home building since 1979 - but one that's not likely to last. Economists expect new-home starts to slow to around 1.5 million for the year. And Henry Kaufman, the Salomon Brothers guru, warns that recent sharp gains in home prices - the median price jumped to $75,500 in January - could soon offset falling mortgage rates and threaten housing's comeback.

That, in turn, could threaten the recovery which stumbled a bit in February, as industrial output rose a mere three-tenths of 1 percent and personal income gained only one-tenth of 1 percent. Manufacturers seem to be waiting for a consumer spending spree before committing themselves to strong increases in production. But the wait could be a long one. Individuals may be $700 billion richer because of rising stock and bond prices, but Morgan Guaranty, in its latest survey, said consumer outlays are influenced more by gains in after-tax personal income than rising net worth.

The Brussels agreement on new parities for the eight currencies of the European Monetary System meant a 5.5 percent upward revaluation of the German mark and a 2.5 percent devaluation of the French franc. By accepting devaluation and the austerity measures needed to make it stick, France's Socialist Government had rejected siren calls to leave the monetary system and reflate its economy behind import barriers.   At the same time, economists and the financial community were discounting their earlier worries about lower oil prices.

Bankers in London, who pride themselves on making more foreign loans than bankers in any other world capital, have had plenty of experience in funding recoveries during recent decades of rollercoaster economic activity. But history may be of little value to them these days.   Lending operations in most international banks here are so severely strained by the near-default of nations in debt-ridden Eastern European, Latin America and other parts of the developing world that bankers say they have little leeway for assisting the recovery they hope will spread from the United States to the corners of the recession-ridden globe.

"  To the Editor:     On your March 14 Op-Ed page, Myer Rashish argued that, in the interests of national security, the U.S. Government should impose a tariff on oil imports. Similar proposals by others (including a Times editorial of March 18) call for a tariff of $5 to $10 a barrel. This would be equivalent to 17 to 32 percent of the current landed costs of imported crude oil.$ Mr. Rashish's proposal runs counter to the growing consensus that declining oil prices will contribute significantly to the emerging economic recovery in this country. Studies by the Congressional Budget Office support this view.   By aborting the recent worldwide decline in oil prices, a tariff would worsen the prospects for economic recovery.  A $10-per-barrel tariff, upon which our econometric studies are based, would reduce real gross national product by 1.5 percent in 1984 and by 2.5 percent in 1985 below the level the economy would reach without such a tariff. The consumer price index would be 2.6 percent higher in 1984 and 3.4 percent higher in 1985 than without the tariff.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/30/opinion/l-an-oil-tariff-that-can-only-hurt-america-065636.html","","To the Editor:","A","30","1983-03-30T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/dba3542c-97c5-5aad-9aef-b4174de52d96",665,"nyt://article/dba3542c-97c5-5aad-9aef-b4174de52d96"

With the 99-cent gallon suddenly a thing of the past again, motorists from Greenwich to Norwich could do little today but complain.","1","22","1983-04-02T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/fd970bd8-2db9-5ff1-a1c6-f40a783f094b",542,"nyt://article/fd970bd8-2db9-5ff1-a1c6-f40a783f094b"
"U.S. Steel, after years of haranguing Congress about the need to keep cheap foreign steel out of this country, is trying to import some for itself. It hopes to buy steel slab - a product not covered by quotas - from the British Steel Corporation for less than it would cost to make at the company's big mill in Philadelphia. But the price to be paid could be much higher than the cost of some cold-rolled steel. The whole idea has infuriated the United Steelworkers union, which recently agreed to wage cuts that management said were necessary to save jobs -jobs that union officials feared they would lose to cheaper imports. Now the workers have lost both money and faith in management.

British Steel's boss is losing his job, but he has another lined up. Ian MacGregor, the former head of AMAX -who is known in Parliament as the Butcher of Britain - is moving on to the country's National Coal Board with instructions to return the Government-owned company to profitability. The Scots-born American citizen tried to do just that at British Steel by slashing employment and output. But the recession-wracked steelmaker is losing as much money now as it was when he took over three years ago. That record has given Britain's unionists - and boisterous M.P.'s - something to hoot about.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/03/business/week-in-business-big-steel-turns-into-an-importer.html","U.S. Steel, after years of haranguing Congress about the need to keep cheap foreign steel out of this country, is trying to import some for itself.

This view was buttressed last Thursday when Nigeria, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said that it did not intend to lower its prices.   Many had expected Nigeria to cut prices in response to a reduction of 50 cents to 75 cents a barrel proposed earlier in the week by Britain, whose oil is directly competitive with that of the economically depressed West African producer.

The agreement follows four years of instability in the oil market.  Because of the Iranian revolution, oil prices exploded: The official price of a barrel of Saudi light crude shot up from $12.70 in 1978 to $34 in 1981. But various factors - declining demand, increased supply from non-OPE C countries, greater use of non-oil energy resources - combined to slash the demand for OPEC oil, which fell from 30.3 million barrels a day in 1978 to an estimated 14.5 million barrels daily by early March.

The meeting, which would be the first since 1971, has been in preparation since at least early 1981, when it was mentioned by the then Soviet leader, Leonid I. Brezhnev, at the Soviet party's 26th Congress. But four high-level meetings in Moscow this year, including one that ended last week, have been unable to agree on an agenda.

"  When the leaders of the industrialized democracies meet at Williamsburg, Va., this weekend, their agenda should include a discussion of the economic problems of the non-OPEC developing countries. They should agree on a course of action to address those problems, which are of direct interest to the United States and the other industrialized countries.   The economic problems faced by the middle-income and the low-income developing countries are equally severe, but different. In the short run, the middle-income nations simply cannot meet their debt payments. The estimated external-debt-service payments owed by many of them in 1983 is more than 100 percent of their revenues from exported goods and services. Argentina's debt-service payments approximate 179 percent of export revenues; for Mexico, they are 129 percent; Brazil, 122 percent; and Chile, 115 percent.  Developing countries' inability to meet their financial obligations is the result of three things: a 7 percent reduction in the volume of world trade, a dramatic increase in real interest rates and the fact that it takes almost 20 percent more exports today to buy the same quantity of imports. Together these have created a serious financial problem that, in the short run, requires a new infusion of credit while these countries re-establish their long-term ability to service their debts. Yet new credit appears to be less and less available. During 1982, the developing countries that are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries received 50 percent less new credit from international banks than in 1981.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/27/opinion/summit-challenge.html","","When the leaders of the industrialized democracies meet at Williamsburg, Va., this weekend, their agenda should include a discussion of the economic problems of the non-OPEC developing countries.

Economics has long been the social science with the most developed technical expertise, abstruse and inaccessible to most people yet of unquestionable relevance to their lives. If, as Snow argued, most educated nonscientists are incapable of describing the second law of thermodynamics or even the concepts of mass and acceleration, this is equally true of such economic terms as aggregate demand function, the Phillips curve and the velocity of money.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/05/books/demystifying-economics.html","","DANGEROUS CURRENTS, The State of Economics.

Today, one major project lies on the scrap heap and spending on the development of heavy oil has been scaled back sharply.   Venezuela's ambitious plans for large-scale exploitation of the Orinoco heavy oil belt, perhaps the largest untapped deposit of heavy oil in the world, fell victim to a variety of circumstances: lower world prices for petroleum, the country's chief export; a reduction in money available for financing projects in the Government-owned oil industry, and major revisions in projections on how much oil the nation would need in coming years to meet domestic and foreign demand.   One American oil executive, who asked not to be identified, said: ''Like other OPEC countries, Venezuela suddenly found out it didn't have enough money to pay for all the fancy projects that were designed when oil prices were high and the country was rolling in cash.''

Difficulties in stretching out Brazil's $90 billion debt, largest in the developing world, preoccupied treasury officials and central bankers last week as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development met to consider balance of payments issues. The International Monetary Fund has held up credits for Brazil on grounds that agreed conditions have not been met.   Third world countries again requested special help last month at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Belgrade, stressing the damage inflicted by oil price inflation. New debt relief measures and more financial assistance, they argued, would enable them to maintain imports, continue development projects and strengthen the world economy. But Western officials told them to stop worrying. As the industrialized economies gather strength this year, the rich countries argued, the third world would share in the benefits.

Many industry experts say that rising demand will allow OPEC to raise its production ceiling in the last quarter of the year, which would require a special meeting.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/20/business/opec-fails-to-pick-secretary-general.html","","The 13 member nations of OPEC agreed here today to postpone the appointment of a Secretary General and to continue debate on long-term strategy at their next regular meeting in December.","D","17","1983-07-20T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/ac595734-b6c9-54cf-b93e-c5bf26e26c66",687,"nyt://article/ac595734-b6c9-54cf-b93e-c5bf26e26c66"

"  The disclosure by the Bank for International Settlements that new loans from Western banks to the third world virtually dried up in the first three months of this year opens bankers to the renewed charge that they are sacrificing the health of the world economy to protect their own interests.   Banks in the industrialized world already stand accused of creating the international debt crisis by overlending to the third world during the 1970's, without proper controls. Congressional committees in the United States now are trying to draft new legislation to restrict future foreign loans by United States banks.   But now the B.I.S. warns that banks are jeopardizing the emerging economic upswing by closing their loan windows just when heavily indebted third world nations need additional credits to finance imports from industrialized countries and get world trade growing again.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/21/business/loan-cuts-and-3d-world-debt-worries-news-analysis.html","","The disclosure by the Bank for International Settlements that new loans from Western banks to the third world virtually dried up in the first three months of this year opens bankers to the renewed charge that they are sacrificing the health of the world economy to protect their own interests.","D","5","1983-07-21T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/c0023281-017d-56f7-aee9-f3371c77f65c",933,"nyt://article/c0023281-017d-56f7-aee9-f3371c77f65c"

"  Paul Volcker had another surprise in his second round of Senate confirmation hearings - the Fed will ease up on its growth targets for the money supply for the rest of the year. Starting in July, the Fed will hold M-1 growth to a 5 to 9 percent range, up from a 4 to 8 percent target that has been in place since the beginning of the year. Moreover, the Fed will not try to offset the 14 percent growth rate in the money supply so far this year, but it will reinstitute the 8 percent upper limit in 1984. The move was seen as an effort to calm the shaky financial markets as well as to keep the recovery on track without letting it get out of hand. At the same time, the Fed chairman exhorted the Congressmen to reduce the huge budget deficits that he said were the ''most important single hazard to recovery.''   Mr. Volcker's efforts to soothe the financial markets seemed to fall apart on Friday after the Fed announced a jump in the money supply of $300 million. The markets had anticipated a drop, and the news sent them spinning as fears renewed that the Fed would have to tighten the financial purse strings again. Interest rates jumped and bond prices plunged. The stock market closed the week some 38 points ahead, and well above the 1,200 mark, at 1,231.17.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/24/business/week-in-business-higher-targets-set-on-money-growth.html","","Paul Volcker had another surprise in his second round of Senate confirmation hearings - the Fed will ease up on its growth targets for the money supply for the rest of the year.

The earnings rise at the world's largest energy company, coming four months after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its crude oil prices 15 percent, reflects improved business conditions in much of the oil industry.   About a third of the earnings improvement came overseas. Exxon, one of the four American partners in the Arabian American Oil Company, which produces almost all of Saudi Arabia's oil, had suffered from a price disadvantage until the OPEC decision in March because Saudi Arabia was charging more for its oil than most other OPEC members.","https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/26/business/earnings-rise-27.2-at-exxon.html","","The Exxon Corporation, benefiting from lower and more stable crude oil prices, increased its earnings in the second quarter by 27.2 percent, the company announced yesterday.","D","1","1983-07-26T05:00:00+0000","nyt://article/cd67904a-09b6-5bd5-9dbd-f9a2e2933945",795,"nyt://article/cd67904a-09b6-5bd5-9dbd-f9a2e2933945"
